Regarding your second point, I think that a reasonable candidate from the Ds would win handily.  Jeffords was the last R to be elected to the senate from VT, and he was pretty moderate, as evidenced by the fact that shortly after his 2000 reelection he switched his party to I and started to caucus with the Ds.  The D/Is elected to senate since 2000 have all won with no less 61% of the vote, more commonly in the 65-75% range. Since Jeffords in 2000, there have been two D and two R governors.  Scott was one of those Rs, the other was Douglas, who eked out a win in a very different political climate against Doug Racine with 44.9% of the vote share, then faced Peter Clevelle, a wholly unlikable candidate, in the next election. 


Vermonters are some of the most educated, least religious people in the nation and are generally understand what is at stake by filling a senate seat with a R in this climate.  I think they can differentiate between having a R in local governance and tipping the balance on a national scale back to the right.  They also consistently rank near the top of all states for eligible voter turnout.  With a secure election system where you know people will show out and a population overwhelmingly supporting Ds for senate over the last 20 years, I think it's about as safe a bet as you're likely to find.  I guess New York, Oregon, or Washington might be safer, with D governors and a blue history, but I don't know enough about their senators to say what cabinet positions would fit them.


Regardless, not opposed to leaving senators off the table... seems safer."

&gt; For example, Phil Scott won election against a trans woman 

Scott has won 5 straight statewide elections in Vermont, 3 as Lieutenant Governor and 2 as Governor. And the polls show he will easily be reelected as Governor on Tuesday.

 Under a Biden Administration I expect more fauxgressive like Buttigieg to be cultivated and plopped into races. These fauxgressives aren't as risky as 2018 faux-moderates since the voter demographic has less rebellion wiggle room. With the faux-mods we saw Katie Hill's seat (CA-25) flip red in special election because moderate voters have more options. Winning elections depends on swing voters or who cheats most effectively.

If Trump wins, Congressional term limits are coming. Best advice to anyone not a Neolib/Neocon or MAGA is to start developing long-term strategies for candidates and platform solution pathways that are rooted in sovereign nation vs global technocracy. Progressives especially need to work on a cohesive agenda that can be pitched to big picture voters and small detail-orientated voters. Even in a larger Party spitballing sessions they need to come with complete plans because outside of the idea of universal healthcare, their solutions start to spiral downward in national popularity. Rising in power/influence when a group is that far from center takes a of voter engagement to normalize and spread."

If Biden wins they will say the takeaway is Neoliberalism is awesome and it will cement this mentality for the next 20+ years.

If Biden loses they will blame Progressives, the Squad, Bernie and whoever so much as shat on them for their abysmal say nothing do nothing campaign that is an almost mirror image of Hillary's campaign.

The power structure is not going to recognize that they made a mistake and something needs to change.  How do I know this?  Because it already happened in 2016.

When Hillary lost both Pelosi and Chuck said they should get behind Bernie and maybe they need to listen to the Progressives and change things.  You have to at least respect that.  Obama came in immediately and shut them down.  He also interfered with the DNC chair vote that was going to Keith Ellison.  

Combine that with the narrative building coming out of the DNC and the Hillary campaign that it was Bernie's fault, his supporters' fault, Russia's fault, Muller's fault.  There was an entire laundry list of fault dished out in Hillary's book on the loss with ZERO introspection of their own failures."

You don't do that unless the situation is pretty serious. And not that reserved - Regeneron's antibody cocktail is in clinical trials with several hundred patients, so it's not as if Trump got the only dose on the planet or anything. The stuff itself, namely biotechnologically produced monoclonal antibodies, is just genuinely very expensive to make, even before any markup on the price.

The reason why Trump's doctors took the risk was likely that the risk actually isn't *that* high, as experimental drugs go. Those antibodies are biochemically the same kind of antibodies that the human body produces naturally, so you're not injecting the patient with anything very toxic or unknown. Still, the antibodies can case unintended immunological reactions in some cases."

J.

In 2018 Miller was accused of drugging his mistress with an [abortifacient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortifacient) drug, by blending a pill into a fruit smoothie. The ensuing controversy caused him to leave his position as a political commentator on CNN.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)#cite_note-47)

In 2019 Miller admitted in court that he had a history of visiting [prostitutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitute) and patronizing ""Asian-themed"" massage parlors.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)#cite_note-48)"

These are the people that grew up promised a job that could support a family with just a high school degree. And they've considered themselves victims because that opportunity stopped in the 80s. They don't want to do anything new, they don't want to try and pull themselves up by the boot straps, they want the easy life they believe they were promised.

Trump says he's going to bring those jobs back. Biden says he's going to help transform those areas. Guess which one appeals to the people too lazy to leave in search of more economic opportunity?

These people don't care about the economy because they have no money in it. They were told they'd have pensions when they retired. Covid? It hasn't reached many of their communities because they're so isolated. And even where it has, they believe it's not a threat. I've seen people post saying they have it only to be met with accusations they're lying, or telling them that they're really suffering from something else and the doctors are lying that it's Covid.

You have large communities of lazy, poor residents that have become complacent with their plight. They have no aspirations so all the potential from Biden falls on deaf ears. They'll never admit it, but when they hear Trump what they really hear is ""I'll give you the welfare that everyone else has gotten but you!"" They don't want an honest opportunity, they don't want to work. They just don't want anyone else getting more than they are."

The other issue with 2016 is that people were far less committed than I think they are this year. The polling for Clinton was up and down all election cycle. Then the Comey announcement hit, as it was already trending towards even. This year is been much more consistent, with Biden's lead growing over the last 2 months.

I remember reading that polling data was off because Trump got a lot of people who don't usually vote to turn out, which meant they were undervaluing those demographics when they ran their numbers.

His base is his base is his base. They voted for him 100% in 2016 and will do again. So thats covered.

He's definitely lost a good chunk of the following:

-  voters who wanted to try a non politician for once
-  a lot of misogynists who hated Hillary
-  his army that is incapacitated/unfortunately passed from Covid

The Democratic ticket has gained a good chunk of the following:

-  voters who wanted to try a non politician for once
-  a lot of misogynists who hated Hillary
-  Gary Johnson/Jill Stein superfans 
-  new voters that were too young to vote but old enough to march after Parkland

- Biden staffer on supreme court religious disqualification

What's cited is not equal to your claim that ""Catholics, Jews, or Muslims should be barred from serving on the Supreme Court"". The remark was based on religious orthodoxy, not common religious affiliation. The argument being that such extreme religious views cannot be universalised in a secular country.

-  Sanders' staffer advocates gulags for trump supporters

I don't think that this is equal to ""trump supporters (and possibly conservatives as a whole) should be put in reeducation camps"" either. People *should* be taught a degree of pluralism and tolerance, especially when facism raises its head. That does not amount to being sent to a camp against your will, however much Project Veritas would like to frame it as such.

&gt; According to the New Jersey Patch, the incident took place in the express lanes and along the grassy shoulder areas of the Garden State Parkway in the Holmdel area of the state.

&gt; The incident in New Jersey Sunday followed a Friday incident where videos showed Trump supporters closely following a Biden-Harris campaign bus as it traveled from San Antonio to Austin, Texas.

2020-11-01 22:01:49,gau317q,t3_jmam6u,Kid_Serious,t1_gau2j7n,"Joe Biden on Saturday prepared to mount a last-minute, two-day blitz of Pennsylvania, amid concern among some local Democrats about a potential late shift that would threaten his narrow advantage there and mirror President Trump‚Äôs 2016 comeback.

Most Democrats still believe Biden will capture Pennsylvania, and he maintains a modest polling lead there, but their confidence has eroded in recent weeks with emerging signs of a tightening contest in the state, according to elected officials, strategists and party activists. Both sides believe the outcome in Pennsylvania will be crucial in determining who wins the White House.

The causes of Democrats‚Äô anxiety are varied. They worry about potential trouble with mail-in ballots during a pandemic. They are concerned about the prospect of a voter surge in White, rural areas favorable to Trump and signs of lower-than-anticipated turnout among the Democratic base.

How the election is deepening divisions in a small Pennsylvania town
In the small town of Milford, Pa., neighbors with opposing political views live side by side. Some feel threatened, others are calling for more understanding. (Zoeann Murphy, Lindsey Sitz/The Washington Post)
They are nervous about GOP efforts to place limits on voting. They cringe at the recent looting and violence in Philadelphia, which Trump has seized on to portray Biden as weak on crime and hostile to police. And they harbor lingering concerns about Biden‚Äôs muddled rhetoric on oil and gas, which has prompted inaccurate attacks that he advocates ending fracking.

‚ÄúI am worried about Pennsylvania,‚Äù said Neil Oxman, a veteran Democratic strategist based in the state. Oxman cited several concerns, including the possibility that Trump‚Äôs base ‚Äúwill come out just a little bit stronger than our base.‚Äù

Many Democrats acknowledge that their doubts may be exaggerated by what happened four years ago, when Trump shocked analysts by narrowly winning Pennsylvania ‚Äî a loss that Democrats did not see coming and have yet to fully recover from emotionally. Since then, consistent Democratic electoral gains in Pennsylvania have prompted Republicans‚Äô own alarms about the state.

But Democrats have found plenty to lose sleep over.

Polling averages show Biden‚Äôs advantage in Pennsylvania has shrunk somewhat and now lies between four and seven points. That is slightly larger than Clinton‚Äôs four years ago, but far from enough for Democrats to feel safe.

Trump himself tore through the state on Saturday, scheduling four rallies as he chased another come-from-behind win.

‚ÄúIn 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president who finally is putting America first,‚Äù Trump said at a rally in Reading, where he played a video of selectively edited clips of Biden‚Äôs comments on fracking and fossil fuels.

Trump‚Äôs day started with a rally in a Philadelphia suburb, where he made a baseless allegation of widespread voter fraud and urged supporters to act as election watchers in Philadelphia.

‚ÄúI have to be very, very careful, especially in this state, more than any other state,‚Äù Trump said in Newtown. ‚ÄúWe have to be extremely ‚Äî everybody has to watch, be vigilant.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, by less than a percentage point, was powered largely by support from White voters without a college degree.

Democrats are wagering Biden can narrow the gap with that group while building a winning coalition with suburban voters and people of color in urban areas. There are signs that is working, as recent Republican polling showed Biden narrowly ahead of Trump in a congressional district Trump won by 10 points in 2016.

Still, Democrats are watching Trump‚Äôs closing push with some trepidation.

‚ÄúThe president has a very strong, sturdy base here, and what he's doing is juicing turnout in those small counties,‚Äù said Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D).

On Saturday, Biden, joined by former president Barack Obama, campaigned in Michigan, another state Trump narrowly won in 2016. The Biden campaign dispatched a diverse army of surrogates across Pennsylvania on Saturday, including Pete Buttigieg, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and actress Debra Messing.

Now he turns his attention to Pennsylvania for the closing stretch.

On Sunday, Biden plans to speak at a ‚ÄúSouls to the Polls‚Äù event with faith leaders in Philadelphia and deliver remarks at a drive-in event there, part of the campaign‚Äôs effort to excite Black voters.

The following day, Biden, his running mate Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and their spouses will barnstorm the state. Biden will campaign in and near Pittsburgh on Monday, and Harris will be on the other side of the state, the campaign announced Sunday. Local Democrats said they expect the effort to touch areas where White suburban and working-class voters will be key.

Biden has run heavily on health care and Trump‚Äôs mismanagement of the pandemic, and his economic plan calls for large investments in manufacturing. But if the message has improved from four years ago, Democrats say, the election process has been upended by the pandemic, and the process of counting ballots in the state could drag on for days.

‚ÄúThe biggest worry I have is still the ballot issues,‚Äù said Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.).

Democrats initially encouraged voters to cast ballots by mail. But the possibility of errors with mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania ‚Äî such as not using a mandatory ‚Äúsecrecy envelope‚Äù ‚Äî has raised Democratic concerns that some votes may be disqualified.

Democrats scored a legal victory this past week when the U.S. Supreme Court allowed state officials to count ballots cast by Election Day and received within three days. Still, the issue may not be fully settled, and Democrats are now encouraging their voters to drop their ballot off in person.

Pennsylvania, where no-excuse mail-in voting is a new option, has seen fewer ballots cast early than other states, amounting to 37 percent of its total 2016 vote. About two-thirds of those early votes have come from Democrats, but a late shift in opinion could have a significant effect.

Those numbers have not calmed the jitters in the party, and not just among Democratic officials. As Election Day draws near, pro-Biden Pennsylvania groups on Facebook have been filled with anxieties and fears.

‚ÄúWith only four days to go, how is everyone feeling?‚Äù one Biden supporter posted Friday night. Within hours, there were more than 1,000 responses, a mix of hope and anxiety, optimism and fear.

‚ÄúNervous to the 10th degree,‚Äù a supporter wrote. Others chimed in: ‚ÄúOn edge.‚Äù ‚ÄúScared very scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSTRESSED.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy nerves are shot.‚Äù Several people wrote that they are sick to their stomachs as they wait for Election Day, and several others feel like they have post-traumatic stress disorder from 2016.

Christina Ramos, a 30-year-old kidney transplant coordinator who lives in Philadelphia, is one of these nervous Democrats. She raised concerns that the recent violence in her city could dissuade some voters from supporting Biden. The unrest followed the police killing Monday of an African American man, 27-year-old Walter Wallace Jr.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of liberal Democrats calling for things like defunding the police, and I think that works to Biden‚Äôs disadvantage,‚Äù said Ramos, a new mother of a 9-month-old.

Biden does not favor defunding the police, and in recent days, he has repeatedly stated that he does not condone violence or looting, as Trump has sought to tether him to the demonstrators. His rebuttal has become so aggressive that some Democrats are annoyed that he is not talking more about the police shooting and racial justice.

The Rev. Mark Tyler, who was out in Philadelphia amid the protests of recent days, said he has sensed fears that the violence could reinforce Trump‚Äôs narrative. ‚ÄúThe story of Walter Wallace has gotten lost,‚Äù said Tyler, a Biden supporter.

In a reflection of the Republican playbook across the country, Future 45, a pro-Trump group, recently released an ad showing an image of protesters shaking and pounding a fence. ‚ÄúRepublicans aren‚Äôt perfect, but they are the only ones who can bring American back,‚Äù says a woman in the ad as she fills out her ballot at home.

Overall, the Democrats‚Äô mood is one of hope mixed with anxiety.

‚ÄúI am absolutely convinced that we have a lot of enthusiasm, too, on our side,‚Äù said Fetterman. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a lot of factors you can‚Äôt extrapolate into a poll that are absolutely significantly in play in Pennsylvania.‚Äù"

I thought this a month ago, if Trump loses, it'll will be that week that he really lost the election.  In a pandemic, the last week a month out is closer to a week out in a regular election, and dems seem to have made a point to not rely on in person voting for one day only, unlike republicans."

They really persuaded HRC voters to stay home or to vote for the fake candidate.  This year, we have positive polls. a reasonable candidate, and good turn out, and we only had one of of those last time.  A raging covid19 rate in WI may lower GOP turn out.

* AZ - I think so.  Signs and polls are positive.

* PA - I hope so but I am not confident.  Polls average to within margin of error.  Much of the Trump base is in the middle and west part of the state. It's clear that Trump is targeting the state for a major ""fake voter"" disinformation campaign.  My main fear is honestly just good turnout by the GOP.  in 2004, the Democrats had their best absolute-number turnout in the history of the U.S. but we lost because the GOP beat their record as well.

Sadly, I think if the powers that be want war, they'll get it. If they want to avoid it, they will find justification for that. Very little of either of these things will spring from objective truths as you and I understand them."

well, here's the problem. Russia and China are more powerful than us now. Trump's done an amazing job of obliterating our ability to exert coercive force on other nations and shrinking our list of allies to almost nothing. So until we can rebuild the good will we've lost, we're not going to be able to do much to Putin.

Going to war with Russia isn't practical. It's only going to result in us irradiating the planet. We can assassinate his generals all we want, but that only pisses him off and we're back to ICBM blitzkreigs.

The ""best"" two options are either to destabilize his government or to deprive him of access to the outside world's resources. Destabilizing his government is hard since he's probably insulated himself against things pretty well. Depriving him of the outside world's resources MIGHT work, but it would take a MASSIVE, world-wide, coordinated financial takedown of ALL of his friends' money which isn't likely considering it risks exposing the US's own ability gather intel.

This is coincidentally why Benghazi is such a difficult event to talk about. Yeah, Clinton KNEW what was about to happen, but if she said anything it would have exposed a number of our intel sources and resulted in the US' intelligence network being compromised. Despite the tragedy of those deaths, the US' ability to play the long game in the intelligence world is more important (or...it was, until the fucking moron in chief blabbed secrets from the CIA/NSA/etc to Putin's agents IN THE FUCKING OVAL OFFICE.)

So, to take down Putin's financial network you'd have to use a LOT of intel from a LOT of sources to pull off a super difficult move that MAY not work the way we intend it to.

The reality is that because of the M.A.D. thing, we really can't do anything more direct to them. Sanctions only work IF Russia stands to actually lose something, which they don't really. Not with China willing to do business if it means market dominance AND sticking it to the US. Also, Europe will never completely stop buying oil from Russia. Russian oil is too practical and easy compared to trying to pipe it from the middle east or ship it from north/south america."

&gt;In the early 1990s, Trump converted Mar-a-Lago from a private residence into a social club, signing a detailed ""use agreement"" for the property and conveying ownership to a corporate entity he controlled named Mar-a-Lago Club Inc.

&gt;The 1993 agreement stipulates that club members could use guest suites for no longer than seven days at a time for three nonconsecutive weeks per year. Trump's lawyer said during a council meeting at the time that Trump would not live there, ""except that he will be a member of the Club and would be entitled to use its guest rooms,"" according to a transcript obtained by the Post.

This might work to vote, but in other circumstances is very definitely a ""private club"" and not his residence."

My guess is since the state rejected the WH that it was within their power to reject ML but they didn't so it's now his residence.

2020-11-01 21:47:53,gau1dkd,t3_jmahzu,-iloathepolitics-,t3_jmahzu,"Imagine being a grown adult who is ""respected"" and has the ""accomplishments"" of Chris Wallace; someone who has a platform most of us can only dream of and a genuine ability to effect change. The most courageous thing he could muster during this entire debacle was to look and sound frustrated during the debate, say a few things afterwards that were vague enough to not get either side too excited or angry, and then says he was ""pissed off"" that a number of Trumps who were knowingly exposed to the virus in extremely close proximity forewent masks, therefore risking at the VERY least hundreds of lives directly. That's it. That's all he's done. He's still employed by the administration's propaganda arm and he's still reaping the benefits of being a high-profile Republican. Who cares what Chris Wallace has to say about ANYTHING? I mean seriously, who gives a shit about this dude? He simply doesnt like the brashness of the current batch of Republicans, and it has nothing to do with any genuine morals. It's an adherence to traditions, norms, and the ways things have always been done. If Donald acted just a little bit more like Bush II or even Reagan, he'd be publicly  on board rather than pretending he wasn't."
2020-11-01 21:40:01,gau0g9l,t3_jmahzu,lmao____,t1_gatzlmh,ie he didn't actually formulate this opinion until after he was told what to think. did this story pop up days after the first debate when he was talking a lot about his regrets in not being able to control the debate?

Lol."

&gt; ""After I had the luxury to think about it, I was pissed off,"" Wallace said in conversation with the Washington Post. ""I mean, did they think that the rules that applied to everybody else didn't apply to them?""

&gt; ""I was upset when it turned out I'd been on the stage in a uniquely vulnerable position, and we found out 48 hours after the fact that the president had tested positive for the coronavirus,"" he continued in the Post interview.

Chris Wallace is the majority of America right now! Considering Trump &amp; Melania were both likely contagious at that point, he has every right to be pissed. Trump‚Äôs downplayed this virus from the start and millions have been affected. When he knowingly continues to put lives at risk, then he no longer deserves to hold office. VOTE THEM ALL OUT!!! üò§"

Obviously not."
2020-11-02 06:57:43,gavj9ie,t3_jmadex,7daykatie,t1_gatzfn8,538 doesn't do polling.
2020-11-02 06:55:32,gavj4jj,t3_jmadex,7daykatie,t1_gatzqz6,Why do you believe that?
2020-11-02 01:40:11,gaurgsk,t3_jmadex,vertigo3pc,t1_gatzhuo,"They're stating the obvious: given the current polling and run up to this General Election, Biden will find it difficult to reach 270 without Pennsylvania (which is a John Madden-esque soundbite on it's own. ""It's hard to win if you don't get enough points!"").

Here's the polling out of Pennsylvania according to 538 blog: 

https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/pennsylvania/

You can adjust the slider below the graph to remove poorly conducted, poor confidence polls. Further, you can see specific polls, like the Civiqs polls, and how they went from Trump +2 in February and March up to Civiqs October 17-21 polls of similar sample sizes with Biden +6. A lot can be said by individual polls, but to watch the polling numbers of a single pollster, with similar sample sizes, show a slide in polling numbers like this is impressive. 

STILL GO VOTE, IF YOU HAVEN'T VOTED YET."
2020-11-02 00:28:59,gaujtie,t3_jmadex,Nulldoesnotequalzero,t1_gau1knn,"Silver was one of the better ones leading up the the election. But a lot of other ones were way off (from the 10% chance of Trump winning from Reuters, 15% NYT, or abysmal 2% from HuffPo). I think a lot of Nate anger is mistaking his Primary predictions with the General election. The 538 articles leading up to election day showed that race was tightening and the trump probability of winning the EC increased to 34 or 36%."
2020-11-01 23:38:02,gaue4nc,t3_jmadex,sfitzy79,t3_jmadex,I fucking hate Nate Silver

Bigger point here is that nate remains a Poindexter here and doesn't really engage with the question of cheating. All the D's aren't freaking out because they think the polls are wrong dude. The concern is the end of democracy starting now - due to the voice of the people being shut down."
2020-11-01 22:36:25,gau71jo,t3_jmadex,Doogolas33,t1_gau1knn,"No. The public does NOT have any idea how polling works. You are correct that he never said she was a lock. He even wrote about EXACTLY the way that Trump was likely to win if he pulled it off. And he nailed it. It wasn't LIKELY to happen, just look how narrowly he pulled off the wins in WI, MI, and PA. 

Silver knows what he's doing. And their model is way more bias in favor of Trump now than it was back then, too."
2020-11-01 22:24:47,gau5ozx,t3_jmadex,thefightforgood,t1_gau0p9p,It's not a prediction. It's a forecast. Nate talks at length about the difference between the two in his book.
2020-11-01 22:19:28,gau52s6,t3_jmadex,FilteringAccount123,t1_gatzfn8,"How did he succumb to ""polling error"" in 2016? [He gave Trump an 28.6% chance of winning based on the available polling data](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/).

Put three blue marbles and one red marble in a bag, and then pick one from the bag at random. Would you be shocked and in disbelief if you got the red marble? Because the odds of getting the red marble are roughly equivalent to the chances Nate gave to Trump to win the election."
2020-11-01 22:18:43,gau4zig,t3_jmadex,sanantoniosaucier,t3_jmadex,"This all depends on voter suppression efforts in each individual state.

2020-11-01 22:11:38,gau45w1,t3_jmadex,Jibbjabb43,t1_gau1knn,"Nate gave Trump a 30% chance in 2016 because a majority of the states were slightly closer and there was a massive amount of undecided votes. He was confident in Hillary but he definitely didn't have her a certainty. 

He's also stated that he expects the Trump chance to change by up to 4% on election day."
2020-11-01 22:04:05,gau3aa8,t3_jmadex,starcadia,t3_jmadex,Trumps entire campaign implodes if Florida or Texas flip

Voter suppression, like cleansing voter rolls and limiting polling places happens each election and is considered in the projections. Shenanigans like Silver brings up are uncommon, legally questionable things that Trump might try like sueing to stop mail ballot processing or stealing/delaying mail ballots."

 &gt; It does¬†not¬†account for the possibility of extraconstitutional shenanigans by Trump or by anyone else, such as trying to prevent mail ballots from being counted.

That's it. End of story. Period."
2020-11-01 21:49:32,gau1knn,t3_jmadex,friend_jp,t1_gatzfn8,"So I'v got a couple of questions. First, Does the public have a good grasp of *how* polling actually works? I'd be the first to acknowledge I don't. So is the public trust misplaced? And as for Silver's accuracy, what were his predictions in 2008/2012, because last I checked, Silver's math for 2016 worked out to something like Trump winning 30 out of 100 with HRC winning 70 out of 100. I think it's even steeper ATM with Trump at 10 out 100 to Biden at 90 out of 100. Was Nate wrong when he still gave Trump a 30% chance? Perhaps my understanding of the math is crap but I don't see where Silver said Clinton was a lock."
2020-11-01 21:42:06,gau0p9p,t3_jmadex,PM_me_ur_goth_tiddys,t1_gatzx03,"Yeah otherwise it wouldn't be a prediction. I think by now he has a good idea on voter suppression's effects across states (e.g., voter id)."
2020-11-01 21:36:47,gau02ur,t3_jmadex,Jibbjabb43,t1_gatzqz6,"To some extent. His model does reflect traditional voting patterns in states, therefore states that are heavily gerrymandered or vote supressed will reflect it.

His model can not take 'all votes should be count by election day' as a rule, though."
2020-11-01 21:36:39,gau02am,t3_jmadex,bokidge,t1_gatyy8m,90 percent actually
2020-11-01 21:35:23,gatzx03,t3_jmadex,6a21hy1e,t1_gatzqz6,"He explicitly states in multiple articles that ""voting shenanigans"" aren't part of the equation. They can't predict that type of activity."
2020-11-01 21:33:58,gatzqz6,t3_jmadex,PM_me_ur_goth_tiddys,t1_gatzidq,I believe Nate said his model takes voter suppression into account (like texas)
2020-11-01 21:31:58,gatzidq,t3_jmadex,StIsadoreofSeville,t1_gatyrsn,It‚Äôs exactly this. Because their model takes votes in one state and implies similar voting in similar states. If Trump wins by suppressing the vote it doesn‚Äôt indicate anything in neighboring states.
2020-11-01 21:31:50,gatzhuo,t3_jmadex,jest4fun,t3_jmadex,"this is fox filtering to us what 538 thinks. *i am sure there is no spin.*

2020-11-01 21:31:19,gatzfn8,t3_jmadex,PM_me_ur_goth_tiddys,t1_gatyy8m,It's gonna be exciting to see if the public regains trust in polls this election cycle after 538 nailed it in 2008 and 2012 before succumbing to polling error in 2016. There actually is a true sense of wonder despite how confident the models are in the electoral college results.
2020-11-01 21:29:57,gatz9ng,t3_jmadex,MrGuyTheDudeMan,t1_gatyy8m,"We do, and it's [85%.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-election-map/?cid=abcnews) Mouse over each state to see the odds"

Overall 538's model gives Biden an 89% chance of winning the presidency."

The efforts of countless people, who spent billions of dollars over years and years and years, has come to a head. And their victory is *still in doubt*. 

Even Trump isn't sure if this is going to work. That's because of the resiliency of our institutions and the natural buoyancy of Americans' spirits.

If you're not happy with what is being done in your name, that's only proper. But it doesn't mean the country is broken. It means the country is *under attack*. Maybe we weren't paying enough attention, back when all of this really began. But we sure are now.

And just that, all by itself, is enough to throw the plans of would-be tyrants in doubt.

Trump has every possible advantage. He even has a plague, where he can tell his followers ""It's not really that bad, just trust me"" while the Dems are offering a harsher truth. And it still might not be enough.

I'm pretty sure people said that Gandhi's approach and Martin Luther King's approach would never work, but they did. We have to find a way.

There's a recurring theme in human life, that when seemingly impossible problems arise, smart people emerge to find a solution.

I'm not smart enough, but I am sure there are smart people out there who can find a way to do this. 

A good starting point is to keep the lines of communication open and not to return the nastiness.

Another important step would be to find ways of connecting with these people that make sense to them within their own frames of reference.

Thus pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. It is bad because life is permanent warfare. This, however, brings about an Armageddon complex. Since enemies have to be defeated, there must be a final battle, after which the movement will have control of the world. But such a ‚Äúfinal solution‚Äù implies a further era of peace, a Golden Age, which contradicts the principle of permanent war. No fascist leader has ever succeeded in solving this predicament.

See, you can say that, but when the majority of Republicans and ""conservatives"" vote for him, then maybe the issue isn't that they *aren't* Republicans, maybe the issue is you don't want accept what the Republican party and conservatives are.

What a political party ""is"" is never set in stone. The Republican party is only ever what the Republican voters decide it is. The Republicans voted for this. They voted for all the scumbags in Congress that validated this.

Trump *is* a Republican because the Republican party overwhelming decided it was the party of Trump.

And if you genuinely believe that Trump is somehow a perversion of what ""real"" Republicans and conservatives are like, you're lying to yourself big time.

Granted things could always change later, but the conservative justices at least to this point seem to have suggested that they are more eager to get the power to step into state elections and block state supreme courts from making their own determinations about state laws for federal elections (which itself is worrisome, especially for the future if state legislatures no longer are concerned about their own state courts), or perhaps giving a near tie to their preferred candidate, than they are about overturning results with no potential ambiguity under state law or halting the count early on.  There are plenty of things to be concerned about with this potential set up and it could lead to an ugly situation if the tipping point state happens to be very close, but the Supreme Court prematurely halting a ballot count, especially shortly after November 3rd, does not seem to be the primary concern at least at the moment."

My guess is Trump will scream and howl about a stolen election. And when throngs of angry Nazis don't flood the street to riot in his support, he'll withdraw to isolation. He'll effectively end his presidency and refuse to do any further work. And he'll specifically make sure no coronavirus aid gets through. Purely to punish us.

Leaving the White House at the time of transition would be humiliating to him. Getting escorted out by the Secret Service would be humiliating. So much guess is he leaves early.  He'll start traveling around. Angrily tweeting and doing interviews. And when his presidency ends he'll be conveniently traveling outside the country. He'll do a Fox News interview where he blames America and says some hateful things. Then he'll say he's never been happier and he always hated the job and was doing us a favor anyway. Reports of some serious investigations will come out. And Trump will conveniently never set foot in the country ever again."

&gt; The latest: Speaking to reporters on Sunday evening, Trump denied that he would declare victory prematurely, before adding, &amp;quot;I think it&amp;#039;s a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election. I think it&amp;#039;s a terrible thing when states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over.""

They're evil but they're clever. They know to cover their own asses.

And honestly, the Trumpheads that would take any of what they say before that as confirmation of a Trump victory are likely going to claim he won either way.

I also don't trust that the media or certain state governments will resist his declaration. The media hasn't been too great at mitigating his bullshit, unfortunately. And many of the swing states (FL to begin with) have republican governor/SOS/Legislature.

I do think we can generally say we know where SCOTUS's loyalty is, but I'm not sure I can say how far they'd go in terms of issuing a ruling that clearly overrides our democracy - I mean, in your scenario, if I'm getting it right, given the timeline of the evening, Trump almost certainly would have to declare victory with only a handful of EVs to his name, as things would look ""good"" for him only very early on, so with only like 50 total called, and thus the vast majority of even *election night votes* not counted, would the Supreme Court really call an election for Trump, with only like 10% of the nation's votes counted and tallied, or IDK, even 40%?

Quick edit: I'm going by [this timeline by 538 for election night](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/both-candidates-might-fall-short-of-270-electoral-votes-on-election-night-but-how-close-might-they-get/) (which you should read, if you haven't) in terms of states that they're saying each candidate will almost certainly win - only very early on does it look good for Trump, but by midnight, Biden will have 80 more EVs than Trump just in terms of states he's almost certainly going to win."

1. 11/3 votes tallied first, across the US. Due to this, he gets a favorable map early, at which point he declares victory.

2. The declaration on its own is worthless, except that at that point the narrative is that the ""dems are trying to steal the election via fraudulent votes to flip the results in their favor!"" Which is an argument recently echoed throughout his admin and even at SCOTUS. This riles up his base, especially those waiting for this type of moment as a call to action.

3. Legal pressure in each state that poses a threat to having Biden amass the 270 needed is commenced, on top of the isolated but vocal outcry of his base (and likely skirmishes)

4. Due to the public pressures,  deliberations on what to do begin but are tied up by legal processes immediately. Im thinking about a large-scale effort of the GOP in Florida in 2000. 

This could be enough (especially if it gets violent) to discourage further vote counting, at least for a time. And even if not, each continued count could end up legally challenged, ultimately heading to SCOTUS.

The goal is to stop Biden from getting certified 270+, and we all know where  SCOTUS' loyalty lies. It ends up in the house, and Trump is re-elected.

Is that not the obvious play here? And could it not happen even if Biden was on his way to a landslide through a combo of:

1. Voter suppression

2. Voter intimidation 

3. Legal challenges and threats of or actual acts of violence by his base

4. SCOTUS favorable ruling"

It needs to *not* come down to one state, like completely and utterly unreliable Florida, so it doesn't hinge on one big battleground per 2000 with Bush v. Gore. I think the fact tons of people who sat out 2016 are turning out in huge numbers, and they're mostly going for Biden is one indication among many that people understand this concept, and are so terrified of a Trump victory, they're turning out when they normally never would.

I think it's also worth taking into consideration any Trump victory would almost certainly be an even more severely lopsided victory than in 2016, which he already lost by just shy of 3 million votes, and the amount of protest that would come with it hinging on the Supreme Court I think would be honestly massive, not to mention the incredible instability of a president Trump attempting to govern for 4 more years, having lost the popular vote by millions, with a Democratic House and it's looking quite likely to be a Dem Senate.

IDK, there are so many fucking bad scenarios that don't involve an unequivocal Biden landslide, so I hope that's what we get Tuesday, but am bracing either way for a rough couple months. It sucks, and I hate that this country has slid this far."

Gore for that to go down, which I assume is why we're seeing such massive turn out, especially with early in-person voting over mail-in voting as we've gotten closer to Election Day.

It seems to me Democrats and those opposed to Trump have gotten the message this needs to be an overwhelming victory to prevent their plans at subverting our democracy, ideally so large it's clear on election night, where enough states that count votes more promptly, rather than over days post-election go to Biden. For example, him winning Georgia on election night would be a good sign of this, and is actually possible.

Many states have slapped down their various attempts at doing so, thankfully, including in Texas with their effort to have *over 100k* legally cast ballots thrown out - a ruling which was a pleasant surprise, honestly.

It's hard to imagine Trump declaring victory even 80 EVs behind, rather than doing a 180 and saying we need to wait for votes to be counted, though I guess he *could*, but how is this different from his long predicted refusal to accept results anyways? Many have been assuming that from day one, and while he can do that, that doesn't stop him from getting escorted out of the White House by force, if necessary, on Jan. 20th.

Georgia is actually slightly leaning Biden, which if it gets called for him the night of, or Florida, Trump can try all he wants to declare victory but this will clearly fly in the face of reality.

I was more worried about a ""red mirage"" than I am now, given the number of states which will have early vote totals on the night of, vs. ones that will be delayed, and the number of early votes cast which are overwhelmingly Democratic. Does Biden have it in the bag, or will Trump make it easy? No, and no, but it's not looking likely at all Trump will be ahead at  any point past the first couple hours, and not by much, or even close to 270 on either side, when only a small amount of EVs will have even been called anyways. I do agree if Trump declares victory later in the evening, or the next day, despite his obvious loss and attempts any extra-constitutional actions to enforce his distorted view of reality, [per this website, people do need to get out in the streets en masse](https://choosedemocracy.us/prepare/#.X2346GhKjGg), and I believe they will.

It's sad it's come to having to prepare for this scenario, and it's a bit frightening to think of the chaos that could easily ensue.

*Suppress the vote as much as possible by decreasing voting options for young people, people of color, and big city voters who are likely to vote blue. 

*Pray that he pulls out enough of the tipping point states that report their results early. Florida is the big one- if Trump loses here, 538 gives him a 1% chance of victory. We will almost certainly have FLA results on election night as they are very quick at counting votes. 

*Call victory early. Trump will take advantage of the way that states are counting the vote, where mail/absentee votes are counted slower than in-person votes. Some states could have Trump up +10 or more on Nov 3rd, but end up with a Biden victory. 

*Use the court system that he‚Äôs packed with MAGA supporters to stop absentee/mail-in votes from being counted. If all votes are counted, Trump will almost certainly lose. But if he can invalidate enough late ballots, perhaps he can pull out wins in PA and AR.

News stations know this and won't call a state until those blue counties results come in. I have seen this election after election in Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, etc.

I predict that Trump knows this pattern, and he will be ready to come out with a big sharpie map showing all the red counties way before even all the counties have come in, and say he's won. And his base will eat it up because it's what they want to hear. It's fucking terrifying."

2020-11-02 04:21:00,gav7okh,t3_jm95hy,psu_xathos,t1_gav5vtt,"If this makes you feel better:

This is what I've seen:

* Young voters in some states are registering in numbers that even exceed that young voter surge that swept Obama into office in 2012. Young voters swing democrat easily.
* Access to voting has been expanded to such an extent that early voting and mail in ballots have exponentially increased in many states. Most of these ballots are democrats.
* Biden's polling nationally well ahead of where Hillary was polling in 2016.
* In individual states, Biden has more paths to victory than McDonald. The only real tossup states are FL, GA, NC, OH, and IA. If every ""lean blue"" states goes blue, Biden wins even if he loses all of those toss up states.
* I've never witnessed this level of public support for a candidate in my life. Former presidents, elected officials, military officials, scientific experts, and just public influencers are clearly lining up behind one candidate: Biden.  It's quite telling at especially the *Republicans* and former Republicans that are lining up behind Biden because of what they're seeing on the other side. It's not just protest votes like in 2016 where they won't vote for either -- they've learned that protest votes are dumb and costly, so they're going to Biden and are vocal about it.
* McDonald hasn't gained anybody that didn't already vote for him in 2016, but he's certainly lost a lot of support from those who did. He's not winning the minds of anybody that didn't already agree with him. His strategy is turning out his base and suppressing the vote elsewhere. Both the early voting and polling data shows that both of these prongs are failing.
* Remember anecdotes are meaningless. You might live in a deep red, pro-McDonald area, but that doesn't mean anything. There are more votes in more densely populated areas that swing blue. For example, it literally won't matter what happens in Pennsyltucky if Pittsburgh and Philly turnout and the reason why PA went red last election was because Philly (especially the suburbs) stayed home. The data suggests that mistake won't happen again.

**What does this mean?**

VOTE. Absolutely none of this should mean to anybody to not vote. But there's real hope here that we can turn the page on these past 4 very dark years."

What Trump claims or says is irrelevant, the election doesn't hinge on him declaring victory or him conceding, and it doesn't hinge on what the networks say, but how the results are handled by the country and a large part of what people DO will be entirely up to how the networks describe the election results and how they counter disinformation from the Trump campaign.

One thing that would go a long way is if any Trump campaign official or surrogate lies while on air, they should be removed immediately their statement corrected, and they shouldn't be allowed back on, ever."

""A day in the Life of Sue Republican.
Sue gets up at 6 a.m. and fills her coffeepot with water to prepare her morning coffee. The water is clean and good because some tree-hugging liberal fought for minimum water-quality standards.
With her first swallow of coffee, she takes her daily medication. Her medications are safe to take because some stupid commie liberal fought to insure their safety and that they work as advertised.
All but $10 of her medications are paid for by her employer's medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance - now Sue gets it too.
She prepares her morning breakfast, bacon and eggs. Sue's bacon is safe to eat because some girly-man liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.
In the shower, Sue reaches for her shampoo. Her bottle is properly labeled with each ingredient and its amount in the total contents because some crybaby liberal fought for her right to know what she was putting on her body and how much it contained.
Sue dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air she breathes is clean because some environmentalist wacko liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air.
She walks to the subway station for her government-subsidized ride to work. It saves her considerable money in parking and transportation fees because some fancy-pants liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.
Sue begins her work day. She has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some lazy liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Sue's employer pays these standards because Sue's employer doesn't want his employees to call the union.
If Sue is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed, she'll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some stupid liberal didn't think she should lose her home because of her temporary misfortune.
It's noon and Sue needs to make a bank deposit so she can pay some bills. Sue's deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some godless liberal wanted to protect Sue's money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the Great Depression.
Sue has to pay her Fannie Mae-underwritten mortgage and her below-market federal student loan because some elitist liberal decided that Sue and the government would be better off if she was educated and earned more money over her lifetime.
Sue is home from work. She plans to visit her father this evening at his farm home in the country. She gets in her car for the drive. Her car is among the safest in the world because some America-hating liberal fought for car safety standards.
She arrives at her childhood home. Her generation was the third to live in the house financed by Farmers' Home Administration because bankers didn't want to make rural loans. The house didn't have electricity until some big-government liberal stuck his nose where it didn't belong and demanded rural electrification.
She is happy to see her father, who is now retired. Her father lives on Social Security and a union pension because some wine-drinking, cheese-eating liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Sue wouldn't have to.
Sue gets back in her car for the ride home, and turns on a radio talk show. The radio host keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. He doesn't mention that Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Sue enjoys throughout her day. Sue agrees: ""We don't need those big-government liberals ruining our lives!‚Äù"

The quickest way to anarchy would happen when the laws are meaningless to the elite and blatantly rubbed in the faces of the rest of the country.

There was no chance of that, though. Trump is not capable of understanding the relevant epidemiology or talking about it, which he has amply demonstrated.

Just a couple of days ago he said that the media would stop talking about covid after the election is over and thus he was suggesting that media only mentions covid in order to hurt his re-election chances. He just basically shot down that talking point when he mentioned lockdowns in Europe.

It's hard to imagine everyone has voted and that's it and Tuesday will have the lowest turnout ever for election day itself. 

I know we've pushed early voting a lot but many still want to just vote on election day. So I'd take these early numbers as a sign we could potentially hit 200 million votes and will indeed have an all time record turnout. For every person I know who voted by mail or went to early voting I know another who plans to vote on Tuesday. 

Everyone is fired up on all sides. I'll be in utter shock if we don't have record turnout. Enough that it will be clear there was extreme voter suppression and the election is fraudulent."

&gt; we've made some of our COVID loss back already.

That would‚Äôve happened anyway, although competent leadership would have made it better. We were rocketing toward a recession before we even knew covid existed. 

See also:

&gt; Starting with Trump‚Äôs inauguration, the Dow has risen from 19,827.3 to 25,075.1 -- an increase of 26 percent. That‚Äôs impressive.

&gt; But it‚Äôs not as impressive as its performance during the equivalent period under Obama. Under Obama, the Dow increased from 7,949.1 to 10,572 ‚Äî a rise of 33 percent.

&gt; [**In fact, the Dow‚Äôs rise was even more impressive under Obama if you start measuring at the market‚Äôs low point, on March 9, 2009, during the depths of the Great Recession**.](https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/jan/08/how-trump-obama-compare-stock-market/) That day, the Dow closed at 6,547.

&gt;On Saturday, the US broke its daily record and reported more than 99,000 new cases. According to The New York Times, nearly two dozen states have reported their worst weeks ever for new cases. And the number of COVID-19 cases in some states, like North and South Dakota, matches that of the hardest-hit European countries, like Belgium and the Czech Republic.

&gt;As of Sunday, COVID-19 has infected more than nine million Americans and killed over 230,000, per Johns Hopkins University's database.

It's dumb of him, if Trump had handled the pandemic as well as, say, Lithuania, we'd have it mostly contained and our economy would be back to something more like normal.   But when you think you're the smartest person in the universe and can just bullshit things away as you have done your entire life, well, here we are."

The FBI did not conclude that - DNI Ratcliffe stated that there was no evidence of Russian disinfo to present at that time.  The FBI only stated they had nothing to add to that at this time.  Big difference between the two.  There are several ongoing investigations - apparently financial in nature.  The FBI is not in the habit of publicly releasing info concerning ongoing investigations. 

In the end, even if this thing isn‚Äôt a Russian disinfo campaign...that doesn‚Äôt mean it should be disregarded as fake.  And it also could mean that it‚Äôs a disinfo campaign involving GOP and Chinese actors.  Which would be important to know.

Fox have dropped the story abruptly, and refuse to touch it, now it‚Äôs clear anyone involved in creating or altering it may be liable for criminal charges.

The democrats are not interested in discussing it now, for obvious reasons. The trump campaign continues to push it, but no news organisations are still pushing it as ‚Äòreal‚Äô. 

It comes down to who wins the election. If Biden wins, we can expect to see more on the investigation. If trump wins, well, the FBI are an organisation he dismisses so he‚Äôs unlikely to care about yet another investigation into his personal wrongdoings.

Either way, I would expect to see Hunter Biden taking Rudi Giuliani to Court in 2021. As is the fashion for trumps campaign staff, Rudi will most likely lose the court case."

&gt; Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress; but no Senator or Representative, or person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States shall be appointed an Elector.

&gt;The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.

Currently that law reads:

&gt; The electors of each state meet in their respective state capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday of December to cast their votes

So SCOTUS can decide whatever they want, but the letter of the Constitution, and interpretation of it, and precedent from it all are extremely clear.  All current laws in all 50 states are very clear about their election processes.  The States get to decide how their electors are chosen in whatever way they feel like, and electors are to cast their votes on December 14th 2020.

SCOTUS making a ruling ordering the method of states conducting their own elections is telling all 50 states to ignore SCOTUS, and that we have an entirely illegitimate Federal government across all branches.  Judicial because it's ignoring our own laws, Legislative and Executive because we would not have had any valid election."

&gt;Following election day, the states are to count and certify popular vote results according to their respective statutory and procedural requirements.When the states have completed their vote counts and ascertained the official results, the U.S. Code (3 U.S.C. ¬ß6) requires the state governors to prepare, ‚Äúas soon as practicable,‚Äù documents known as Certificates of Ascertainment of the vote.The certificates must list the names of the electors chosen by the voters and the number of votes received in the popular election results, also the names of all losing candidates for elector,and the number of votes they received. Certificates of Ascertainment, which are often signed by state governors, must carry the seal of the state.One copy is forwarded to the Archivist of the United States (the Archivist), while six duplicates of the Certificate of Ascertainment must be provided to the electors by December 14, the date on which they meet."

Unless they had a rockstar candidate it would be a instant loss after California and New York had their turn at the polls.

This is also why gerrymandering and dicking around with voter suppression are a thing when candidate appeal to lure voters to their side during an election cycle doesn't work. They target specific regions which have high democrat turnout and try to invalidate their vote.

These tactics are the norm for the smaller unpopular political party trying to remain relevant. The republican politicians somehow can sit on the sidelines and just let the lawyers and courts go fight it out, as if they are not accountable for it after everything is said and done.

When was the last time all these local, state, and federal level debates hammered home the last election cycle antics two or four years ago? It's ancient news by then when it shouldn't be. This whole thing works because our attention span as voter is too wrapped up in the latest gossip surrounding a candidate and not the much more important voter suppression issue they were a part of to literally steal an election during the previous election cycle."

Also, Ohio almost never determines the winner of the election. It's just that Ohio's election result tends to correspond with the overall EC winner.

Ohio has been weakening as a bellwether with every decade, because it has been losing EC votes with every census for decades.

It's the Keystone State that is the key state this year. Biden doesn't win without PA, and PA has something like an 85% probability of going to Biden. If that happens, the probability of a Biden win goes to 99%, regardless of Ohio.

Trump can win NC, GA, FL, AZ, and OH, but without PA he can't win the EC."

The state went for Clinton and Obama as much as it has gone for a Bush or Trump. The key is getting city voters to show up in as many numbers as rural voters.

I do agree that it is not a good representation of the overall voting populace, and not a good bellwether now, though it has been considered one up until now."

We need more heroes from these agencies to expose when there is criminal activity being done by our intelligence agencies against the American people. I think it‚Äôs the ultra wealthy that are calling the shots in the CIA, NSA, FBI. They have been compromised to serve the billionaire elite, and not the American people. I think that the media is working with/for these agencies to maintain control of the populace. They realized the biggest threat to their power over us was not foreign nations but the American people themselves rising up against them.

So, any way you look at it, race is coming on the back-burner.[11][12][13]

Nurses and allied health (respiratory, lab, imaging) are almost always hourly. The latter group is definitely getting overtime in areas where COVID cases are high. Hospitals do bill more when the census is high. It doesn‚Äôt mean those bills are paid."
2020-11-01 21:56:48,gau2for,t3_jm66i7,Cryingbrineshrimp,t1_gatd17s,"I kept seeing this on FB in the comments of news outlets. Often, the person would say their friend at a hospital told them so. I would comment, ‚ÄúWould you mind sharing your friend‚Äôs name and employer so I can report them for Insurance/Medicaid/Medicare fraud?‚Äù That shut them down quickly."

This was hardly the only topic he lied about during this episode. What‚Äôs worse is that the media gets manipulated by people like Miller and we end up with two different standards: a high one for Democrats and a non-existent one for Republicans. Mark my words, if Biden appears to be winning as the votes are tallied but Trump doesn‚Äôt concede, no one in the media will question it. Were it the other way around and Biden is losing, that‚Äôs the only question they‚Äôll ask."

[source](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/523740-american-medical-association-rips-trump-claim-that-doctors-are)

Trump straight up assumes everyone is as morally bankrupt as he is. If he were a doctor, he'd be taking all the COVID kickbacks he could - aren't *all* doctors?"

He so obviously doesn't.  He 100% takes the evangelical vote for granted."
2020-11-01 19:22:09,gatjcz3,t3_jm66i7,Mestoph,t1_gat63j2,The only thing I've seen about it has to do with insurance billing.  For simplicity apparently some insurance companies pay a flat rate for covid cases (rather than having to itemize each case).  Some people interpret this as Doctors inflating Covid cases for larger insurance payouts (which ignores that this could then be true of literally any disease).
2020-11-01 19:16:15,gatilz1,t3_jm66i7,Mestoph,t3_jm66i7,"Doctors are profiting off Covid in exactly the same way any provider of a short supply/high demand service profits off of peak need for them.

2020-11-01 18:31:46,gatd17s,t3_jm66i7,FoolhardyBastard,t1_gat91jo,"These people have a fundamental misunderstanding of how insurance and Medicare billing work.  Doing what they say is happening is legitimate fraud.  Medicare and private insurance companies, as well as hospitals have mechanisms in place to prevent this.  Saying this is happening is 1. Accusing physicians of committing fraud
2. Basically stating that your OWN federal government agency (CMS) is allowing said fraud to happen, and you are doing nothing about it."

&gt;In 2016, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette publisher and then-editor in chief John Robinson Block was photographed on a private plane with presidential candidate Donald Trump. The photograph was shared with Pittsburgh City Paper by a source who took a screenshot of it from Block‚Äôs Facebook page with the caption, ‚ÄúIn 39 years of full time journalism I‚Äôve met many interesting people. This one was more than memorable.‚Äù In the photo, both men are smiling and Trump is giving a thumbs-up to the camera.

&gt;The photo circulated widely on social media throughout the city, with some claiming it showed the head of Pittsburgh's largest newspaper favoring Trump. But what didn‚Äôt circulate as widely in Pittsburgh at the time was that Keith Burris, then the Toledo Blade editorial page editor, was also on the plane with Trump and Block."

So my view on this particular topic is that trumps low approval rating does not directly mean that the will of the people is being denied. All it means is the people thet asked said hes not doing what they consider a good job. I mean I guess that's what they ask. I have never been polled for anything and I dont know one single person who has ever been polled on any political topic. Now obviously biden cant have an approval rating for president but if I was to judge him by his actions or lack of throughout his career then I would rate him extremely low. 


So my original comment in this thread is that even with low approval ratings I believe trump will still win. I think this is more of an indication of how bad a candidate biden is. Honestly I cant believe he has the support that he has from the left. He is on record as being against things I thought the left was for like gay rights and he was against the whole bussing thing back in the day. He called an ex klansman his mentor for fucks sake. Anyways trump should have been easy to beat, and maybe I'm wrong about thinking it's close and trump will get blown out.

But it wasn't his goal to sow discord, to destroy or deconstruct. That implies he cares about anything other than himself. He doesn't. He just saw that he could get praise by meeting the base desires of a group of people, and he did so with no larger awareness, or care, of what would happen to the country when he did so."

Trump's is consistently low and below 50% in most polls except for the really biased ones (e.g., Rasmussen).  The only president that really compares in modern times is Gerald Ford, and even Ford managed higher than 50% at the start and a couple of other times.

Trump is a sustained unpopular, sub-50% president.  It's an achievement to do that so consistently poorly.

President Donald Trump has threatened to hold back federal funding from two election battleground states that are making it easier to vote by mail during the pandemic.

&gt;‚ÄúMichigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,‚Äù Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. That brought strong criticism from Democrats in Michigan and elsewhere, pointing out that the state was sending applications, not actual ballots, an error the president corrected in a subsequent tweet six hours later. He stuck with the rest of his tweet: ‚ÄúThis was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!‚Äù

&gt;For some, the list is on a physical paper or bookmarked on a computer. For others, it's merely tattooed into their brains. It consists of which colleagues voted against Hurricane Sandy funding back in 2013, and it‚Äôs chock full of Texas Republicans. 

&gt;In fact, nearly every Texas Republican who was serving in Congress at the time voted against the $50.5 billion aid bill. And now their own constituents are facing the biggest natural disaster in state history.

&gt;‚ÄúThere is deep and lingering resentment by members of Congress who needed help in their districts when Sandy just ravaged their constituents,‚Äù said former U.S. Rep.

&gt; Trump has a median approval rating of 44 percent throughout his time as president, but he never cracked a majority of approval among Americans in every single poll.

&gt; Former President George W. Bush had a 51 percent median approval rating, although he reached an 88 percent approval rating right after the September 11, 2011 attacks-only to leave office in January 2009 with a 27 percent approval rating, by far the lowest of all recent presidents.

As others have stated, it's very different this time.  Biden's lead in the important states is much larger, there are less than half as many undecideds, voter turnout is going to shatter previous records, Biden's favorability ratings are much higher....

2020-11-02 23:23:47,gay6afo,t3_jm5dl2,nexusnotes,t1_gay2s25,"Bernie had issue with the lack of transparency throughout the primary. Not just with caucuses. A lot of standard primaries aren't transparent either or they used easily compromised, dated hardware. There's no uniformity with primaries. There's also issues with the amount of polling places. In 2016 NY literally had purges of 100s of thousands of ballots among many other issues. State parties and governments usually control how they go."
2020-11-02 23:18:31,gay5pe7,t3_jm5dl2,nexusnotes,t1_gay2wsh,There's no time limit. I can wait.

2020-11-02 22:41:14,gay1fow,t3_jm5dl2,nexusnotes,t1_gaxxmok,"Also there was no inherent issue with the caucus. There was an issue of the initial implication of the completely untested shadow app, the lack of transparency, and the conflict of interests. All the other states, including the ones that used the same app, went off without a hitch."
2020-11-02 22:37:15,gay0yu1,t3_jm5dl2,nexusnotes,t1_gaxxmok,"Yes that's what the disinformation campaign says, but do you have any evidence of that?"
2020-11-02 22:09:03,gaxxmok,t3_jm5dl2,elminster000,t1_gaxw76a,Nope. I'm saying only Bernie's campaign specifically wanted to preserve the caucus in Iowa vs adopting a primary.
2020-11-02 21:57:08,gaxw76a,t3_jm5dl2,nexusnotes,t1_gaxt93v,"You're acting like the Bernie campaign was the only one complaining post Iowa. Almost every campaign, including the Biden campaign, was up in arms. Are you insinuating that there were no Clinton delegates in others campaigns or that the DNC officials disappeared post 2016. Because thats inaccurate too. Almost all parties relevant during the unity commission were relevant now. Also simple math, someone with less than a majority of votes in the unity commission doesn't have the influence to ""make rules"". That's simple math."
2020-11-02 21:32:57,gaxt93v,t3_jm5dl2,elminster000,t1_gaxp6s8,"Ah, of course, it's the fault of ""the establishment"". No one other than Bernie's team wanted to keep the caucus, which is ironic considering he claimed to have won ""the popular vote"" when there aren't votes and many are excluded, and when he was the only person in the race who had influenced the rules and therefore should have known you win by delegates."
2020-11-02 20:59:52,gaxp6s8,t3_jm5dl2,nexusnotes,t1_gaxljyg,"You've got all the talking points qued up. Thanks to Bernie there was transparency. With the unity commission post 2016 Bernie's delegates only had a third of the vote on changes with DNC officials and Clinton delegates making up the other two thirds. The Bernie delegates wanted complete transparency due to all the suspected shadiness in 2016 without the transparency to confirm it, but he didn't have the votes to make unilateral changes. The lack of change is in fact due to the establishment. The Shadow app was completely Tom Perez and the Iowa DNCs doing."
2020-11-02 20:30:53,gaxljyg,t3_jm5dl2,elminster000,t1_gaxkdvl,"It's not a talking point. All caucuses are riddled with inaccuracies, they were never as rigorously documented as this one which is why it seems worse. They should have dropped them after 2016, but thanks to Bernie they didn't."
2020-11-02 20:21:38,gaxkdvl,t3_jm5dl2,nexusnotes,t1_gawd9a1,"That's the talking point, but it's quite the understatement. No other caucus has had these issues. It was bad enough for the DNC chair to lose their job. It's unheard of for a state to revise their numbers due to public outrage and blatant inaccuracies with already published vote tallies on the NYT. I wish it was unheard of using a shadow app with conflict of interest and no transparency to run the vote, but shadiness like that is to be expected in the DNC primary."

If I was working in government I'd get fired for having that type of conflict of interest. A judge would have to recuse them self from a minor court case due to conflict of interest, much less deciding the leader of the most powerful country on the planet. It's not a conspiracy theory; that's how the fucking world works if someone with the most financial ties with a consultant receive favorable results. The obvious next step is to question the results.

They literally had Pete winning Iowa before literally every other campaign called them out on blatant inaccuracies. They then dialed buttiegieg's numbers back, but still had him out performing polling. Everyother polling front runner underperformed.

He wasn't able to win with the Shadow app he financed, but he was able to slow roll Bernie's win enough to undermine Bernie winning the first 3 states that always leads to candidates winning the primaries.

2020-11-02 04:16:56,gav7bg1,t3_jm5dl2,nexusnotes,t1_gav5976,"Correct. We wouldn't see that the initial figures were so off even the NYTs was looking at them side ways, they retracted them because of Bernie's request for more transparency. Why would you want to win the historically most important state to win in the country that his campaign almost spent all their funds to win? Buttiegieg's entire campaign was based on winning Iowa. He spent almost no time in later states. Part of the reason he dropped out early even in 2nd place at the time post NC."

2020-11-02 22:27:14,gaxzsjn,t3_jm5a9r,tacoman333,t1_gaw7u65,"You are an atheist which is defined as ""a person who disbelieves or lacks belief in the existence of God or gods,"" and is derived from the Greek word  ""atheos"" meaning ""without god."" How you express that belief is your own business, but just like a theist who keeps their religion to themselves and a theist who tries to convert nonbelievers are both theists, you and an atheist who chooses to be more reserved are both atheists.

Atheism by itself is just as reasonable a position as any, but once you call religion inherently garbage, you have insulted an integral part of billions of peoples' identity and are being hateful. I could bring up the many ways that religion has advanced scientific pursuits and benefited the world, or the fact that many religious people aren't even theists and therefore don't fit in your narrow view of religion, I could prove that religious people and non-religious people have coexisted for quite a long time, or shown how cruelty isn't the sole domain of religion and atheism has driven many brutal and inhumane acts, but I have the feeling from reading your comment that my time would be wasted. You will reject whatever evidence I present because you have decided for whatever reason to hate religion, and no reasoned argument by itself will change your mind.

A while ago I posted a comment which denounced the Proud Boys and labeled them white supremacists. Shortly after, I received a private message from an angry redditor that verbally attacked me, calling me a leftist nazi (?) and other nasty names. In many ways, their comment reminds me of yours. They too insulted my intelligence, said that my beliefs were dangerous nonsense, suggested I was lazy and cruel, and after the rant, told me that I shouldn't respond because I wasn't worth their time.

It should scare you that your rhetoric shares so many similarities with someone that was in all likelihood a white supremacist. Before you can fight the issues that exist in religious institutions (and believe me there is a lot of them), you should start by looking at the bigotry and hatred within yourself."

Many years ago I read a reasonable bit of rationale as to why the church looks to the right, when a government is paired back to the bare minimum with title to no social support the church steps in and provides community support to the destitute and needy. To the church it‚Äôs appealing, it offers the control they had over society pre modern government and it elevates the church leadership to dominant roles in society. It‚Äôs all about control."

Your respect means less than nothing to me.

It is clear you have no knowledge of basic history- another hallmark of the myopia required to believe in this nonsense.

Coexistence is clearly impossible, again, history proves you wrong.

Furthermore your refusal to attempt to defend your position with proof, as opposed to a tired old scold is just par for the course for you lazy and cruel theists.
 
So, for the record, and in closing, you would do well to educate yourself. You‚Äôve foolishly labeled me an atheist, when a modicum of intelligence would show that I am an ardent anti-theist. I labor to free men from the spiritual slavery you so eagerly endorse.

You can‚Äôt prove your point and your failure reveals you to be a fool. Now leave me alone, for you‚Äôre just wasting both our time with your pitiful ignorance."

Please don't tar and feather us all together.  I have family members who are also quite pro-life, but have put their money where their mouth is by fostering many kids over the years.  I hope that dispels at least a tiny bit of your dislike and distrust."

If one were to rely solely on the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth, it‚Äôs a fairly safe bet that they‚Äôd be pretty all right people.

He preached not to judge others on this earthly plane, for final judgment rests solely in the hands of our infinitely wiser Father in Heaven. 

He specifically states that the teachings of the Old Testament should no longer hold sway in the hearts of men ‚Äî things like painting your door for Passover, circumcising your male children, selling your daughters like stock, stoning people to death for their transgressions.

A little history: the term evangelical was a term that started to rise up around the mid-late 1800s. The movement was spurred by these high-emotion experiences people had with Christianity outside the church. People started to move away from needing a conduit (the church) to have a connection with god, to a personal relationship with Jesus. The term again changed during the civil rights era, when it became more of a political movement than a religious one. 

Today, the term evangelical is completely a political term. Evangelicals are ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù who support the GOP and their political agenda. Christians are people who are dedicated to living their life in accordance with the teachings of Christ.

Those two things are wholly incompatible. Evangelicals are not dedicated to their religion, they are dedicated to politics that are in direct contradiction to the teachings of Jesus Christ."

Economics, in my opinion. 

Evanagelicism is kind of weird. It's finding a proper middle ground between your needs and beliefs and those of your parish. So if your parishioners beleive something very strongly, you're not likely to go against the grain. Otherwise people will go somewhere else.

Even in big C Catholic where dogma is completely uniform. The masses are 99% the same, but the content and tone of the homily will generally reflect the views of the parish... For example, our regular parish is a very diverse place. The head priest gave a homily about how it is everyone's individual choice whether to vote for Biden (who is Catholic) or Trump (who is pro-life, and the Supreme Court thing was mentioned.) Basically saying there isn't a moral choice or a preference of the church. 

We go to another parish with a much smaller, less diverse congregation, and the homily is more about the sanctity of life, how everyone would want to die a martyr. I was a little blown away."

2020-11-02 11:52:07,gavzdxn,t3_jm522x,Gambit08,t1_gavonyo,"If he is not permitted to vote by the state, that is literally the definition of disenfranchisement. Disenfranchisement can have meritorious arguments, but it‚Äôs still disenfranchisement, this is 3 years of law school talking."
2020-11-02 08:30:46,gavonyo,t3_jm522x,CJSinTX,t1_gasyxpt,"I also have an adult son and we have his guardianship just like this guy.  You must go to court and take away their rights in order to have their guardianship.  This means he cannot make his own decisions about medical care, education, anything legal, etc.  Basically the same as if he is a minor child.  

The court procedure is long, thorough, and expensive.  He has a Lawyer Ad Litem representing him, that the parents pay for, and the parents have a different lawyer.  We had two home inspections, one from his lawyer and one from the judge‚Äôs staff to make sure he is in a good environment.  They meet him and ask him questions, they look around the house, etc.  There is also a lot of govt paperwork you must have completed by various other people.  They are very, very careful when they are taking away another adult‚Äôs rights.  We also must file paperwork with the state every year and we have home inspections every two years.  

So, they aren‚Äôt disenfranchising him, if he isn‚Äôt able to make his own decisions then how can he do so to vote?  He will just vote however his parent/guardian tells him to Vote.  My son wouldn‚Äôt be able to understand the procedure well enough to vote alone so that wouldn‚Äôt work either.  Again, once their guardianship is established they are the same as a minor child, who also can‚Äôt vote.  Nothing nefarious here, it‚Äôs all about protecting adults who cannot take care of themselves and they are very, very careful about who gets their rights taken away and who receives those rights as the guardian."

We also have his guardianship so he also isn‚Äôt allowed to vote.  Usually (but not this year to keep him safe) we vote as a family, with him and the big brother and even though he doesn‚Äôt get to vote he does get our 3 ‚ÄúI Voted‚Äù stickers, lol.

*****
&gt; White House COVID-19 adviser Dr. Scott Atlas appeared on Russian state media on Saturday and criticized lockdown measures aimed at tackling the virus, saying they were &amp;quot;Killing&amp;quot; Americans.

&gt; Atlas told RT&amp;#039;s Going Underground that COVID lockdowns had been a failure and were contributing to American&amp;#039;s problems.

&gt; Atlas said the U.S. was &amp;quot;Hysterical&amp;quot; about COVID-19 and that &amp;quot;The public health leadership have failed egregiously and they&amp;#039;re killing people with their fear-inducing shutdown policies. They are literally killing people.""

&gt; He‚Äôs upset about having to run against Biden, the Democrat who worried him so much that he tried to pressure Ukraine‚Äôs leader last year to announce a bogus investigation. That led to Trump‚Äôs impeachment by the House, a permanent stain on his presidency.

I hope the fanatics can recover from a deep despair that will appear upon a resounding defeat.

When what they SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING was saying "" we can't believe it. We don't understand why people allowed this man to walk out and say these things.

 The party of Christian Family Values is the party of pedophilia.

They nominate (and vote for) known pedophiles like Trump (who [admitted his sexual crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape), including his [crimes with teens](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-former-miss-arizona-tasha-dixon-naked-undressed-backstage-howard-stern-a7357866.html)) and Moore, who got over [600k votes in his election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore_sexual_misconduct_allegations), despite his pedophilia being well-known. Lots of prominent Republicans defended his pedophilia. Here are two examples.

Alabama state Auditor Jim Zeigler defended Moore's alleged sex crime actions on biblical grounds,[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore_sexual_misconduct_allegations#cite_note-75) and Alabama State representative [Ed Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Henry_(Alabama_politician)) went so far as advocating the prosecution of Moore's accusers criminally.

‚Äã

The Democrats, on the other hand, do not knowingly elect pedophiles, and have attempted to introduce many anti-pedophilia laws, such as legislation making it illegal for adults to marry 12 year-olds (and younger) in three separate states. GOP legislators blocked all three efforts.

Idaho: https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article226944034.html

Republican justification: ""If we pass this legislation, it will then become easier in the state of Idaho to obtain an abortion at 15 years old than it will to decide to form a family and create a family for a child that has been conceived""

Tennessee: https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/03/07/tennessee-republicans-child-marriage-bill-gay-marriage-argument/404559002/

Republican justification: ""House Republicans effectively¬†killed a bill Wednesday that would prohibit child marriages in Tennessee, citing an obscure legal theory that passing the bill could deter a conservative lawyer's case against gay marriage.""

Kentucky: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kentucky-child-marriage-ban-delayed-vote-conservative-group-opposition-lawmakers-us-a8240121.html

Republicans justification: They wanted to preserve parental rights to give permission for children under the age of 16 to get married. 

The more you understand about Christianity, the more sense it makes they'd overwhelming be Trump supporters."

Forty-five percent of respondents said Biden was not honest or trustworthy, compared to 60 percent who said Trump was not.

&gt;Trump received the same marks on honesty and trustworthiness in polling ahead of his victory in the 2016 election. However, unlike the new survey, then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton received worse ratings on the same question in 2016, with 33 percent saying she was honest and trustworthy compared to 64 percent who said she was not."

2020-11-01 22:24:30,gau5ns2,t3_jm4eg6,eternal_nova,t1_gaty888,"Mmmm ok I see what you‚Äôre saying, and it does make sense.  If you view elections as discrete events with no relationship to each other then his model is never tested.  So in order for his model to have relevance, election results need to correlate to previous election results.

I suppose that is a fair point, and one for which there probably isn‚Äôt a conclusive answer.  For the safe states yes, there‚Äôs clearly a historical trend.  California isn‚Äôt suddenly going red, and Wyoming isn‚Äôt suddenly going blue.  But elections aren‚Äôt determined by the safe states, so all it would take is for his entire model to collapse is for the swing state results not to have any connection to previous elections.

The probability prediction could probably be explained better on his site, since all it‚Äôs saying is they ran a simulated election using his model X amount of times, and it came out with Biden winning in 90% of the results.  That number fluctuating by a couple points isn‚Äôt super meaningful.  If it drops from 90 to 50, then we need to figure out what‚Äôs going on there.

Your point is interesting though.  My suspicion is that elections aren‚Äôt discrete events even in swing states and do have relevance from one cycle to the next, but I‚Äôm not sure how we‚Äôd even go about proving that.  I concede though that if they‚Äôre not discrete, Silver is just playing with numbers that aren‚Äôt testable at all.  You‚Äôve given me something to think about for sure."

The big picture: FiveThirtyEight gives President Trump a 10% chance of winning the election and Biden a 90% chance.

Oh ffs. Nate making sure that no matter what happens, he said it ‚Äúmight happen‚Äù."
2020-11-01 21:21:24,gaty888,t3_jm4eg6,TrueOriginalist,t1_gatovhr,"See that‚Äôs the problem here - it‚Äôs always a different event with a new evaluation provided by Silver. That‚Äôs why you cannot compare it to poker - there you can repeat the known variables and go with the probability that had been established. And in a long run your results should match the original prediction. With the elections, Silver needs to make a new prediction every time. Therefore, you have no way to show whether his predictions are precise. Imagine, as an example, he gives Obama 95% chance to win in 2008 and 80 % in 2012 and he gives Trump 60 % in 2016. He will get all the winners ‚Äúright‚Äù but how do we know that the percentage was correct? What if in fact Obama had 40 % and 60 % respectively and Trump had 80 %? Will we ever know? You cannot use math and you cannot repeat the event. 

As I read the statistics you provided, I admit (ignoring, for the sake of argument, that he only gives probabilities) that it seems Silver can very often predict the winner. But my main problem is with his probability model in these unique events. When I see people going crazy that Biden previously had 90 % chance and then it dropped to 89 % (or even if it was say 70 %) I‚Äôm just thinking it doesn‚Äôt make much sense."

Would you argue you're neither right nor wrong when filling that bracket out?  You're looking at what you think the probability of each round is and saying the team you think is more likely to win will win.  How is that any different than Silver's forecast saying one candidate is more likely to win than another?

Or going back to weather.  If a meteorologist's model correctly forecasts the weather across 49 states, would you say that model is neither right nor wrong because it rained in the 50th state?

Or what about when you're playing poker.  Your read is that your opponent is a 30% underdog, so you push all-in.  Your opponent catches one of his outs on the river and felts you.  Was your play right or wrong?

If you want to play semantics and say probability doesn't lend itself to ""right"" and ""wrong"", then sure.  But the argument that his model isn't falsifiable is what I was arguing against.  A model that attempts to predict what will happen is inherently falsifiable.  If it correctly predicts things more often than random chance would, then it has some level of accuracy.  Silver's model has consistently done that, and the man himself has consistently mapped out what would have to happen for the underdog to win.

If you're saying an event is more likely to happen than not happen, and that event happens repeatedly, that gives you credibility."

We would do this according to the two following principles:

 1. You will gain points if your prediction is correct, and you will lose points if you are incorrect.

 2. The number of points you gain/lose is tied to the certainty you place on your prediction. The more certainty you have is tied to ""exponentially"" increasing reward/penalty.

Example: in 2016 let's say a forecaster named Alice gives Trump a 10% chance of winning and Clinton a 90% chance of winning. Another forecaster, Bob, gives Trump a 30% chance of winning and Clinton a 70% chance of winning.

We can calculate a score based on the odds each forecaster gives the candidate who actually won (Trump). Suppose p is the probability assigned to the winning candidate. Then the odds a forecaster assigns to the winning candidate is

p / (1-p)

So for Alice, we have p = 10% = 0.1. The odds Alice has given Trump is

0.1 / (1 - 0.1) = 0.1 / 0.9 = 1/9

For Bob, we have p = 30% = 0.3. The odds Bob has given Trump is

0.3 / (1 - 0.3) = 0.3 / 0.7 = 3/7

Now, we could stop here since Bob's odds seems to reward him more than Alice's odds did for her. But remember, we want to penalize wrong predictions that are ""certain"" very strongly. So we can use something called log-odds, which is just the natural logarithm of the odds.

log-odds = ln(p / (1-p))

We already calculated the odds that Alice and Bob had given Trump, so if we just take the natural logarithm we get

Alice's log-odds for Trump = ln(1/9) = -2.197

Bob's log-odds for Trump = ln(3/7) = -0.847

As we can see, Alice and Bob are both penalized according to the log-odds score they received when Trump won. But Alice was penalized a LOT more than Bob was.

Suppose we have a third forecaster, Charlie. Charlie is not very good at forecasting, and is prone to assigning very high probabilities according to prevailing wisdom. Charlie gives Trump a 1% chance of winning and Clinton a 99% chance of winning. What happens to Charlie using our log-odds score?

Charlie's log-odds for Trump = ln(1 / 99) = -4.595

So Charlie has lost over twice as many points as Alice has, even though he only gave Clinton ""9 percentage points more"" probability of winning. The closer to absolute certainty you get in this scheme, the more you win/lose."

At the same time, Anthony Fauci was the newly appointed head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the very same position he currently holds. As the public face of the scientific mission to combat AIDS, he got a lot of collateral flak for being tied to Reagan and their public statements. In addition he got a lot of flak due to anger at the speed of the drug approval process and that they couldn't access drugs while they were going through clinical trials. Fauci ended up finding a way to streamline the process and manage the AIDS crisis in a way that won him plaudits from the gay community.

Remember half the world is using HCL and their rates of infection are generally lower than ours.  Fauci's standard is the gold standard of everyone is protected through a vaccine which currently does not exist as of now.  One of the body's defenses is Vitamin D.  Sunlight helps the body synthesize Vitamin D.  Facui demanded everyone stay indoors.  IMO he is a jerk not qualified for his position.

2020-11-01 20:13:36,gatpre5,t3_jm46mu,ThrongSong-,t1_gatl39g,"The left never talks about the mortality rate, only the infection rate, because they can spin the latter but not the former. 

The left never talks about Sweden, which did not shut-down but only targeted at-risk groups, resulting in a mortality rate that was slightly higher, but which then subsided, resulting from a herd immunity that now has Sweden in the same position as Europe/US, but WITHOUT destroying their economy. Sweden basically didn't alter their way of life at all and yet suffered no greater rate of deaths than even the nations with the most draconian lockdowns, like Australia. 

The left never talks about the censorship of doctors who came forward to ask questions about why they were being pressured to attribute every death involving corona as a corona virus death, no matter the comorbidities. 

The left never talks about the dramatic decrease in deaths due to the seasonal flu, even though the exaggerated attribution of every death being covid-related has no doubt suppressed the mortality rate attributable to the flu.

Even with their attempts to inflate the mortality rate of covid the mortality rate is low. Now we understand the virus better, that it is highly infectious and thus overwhelmed hospitals when precautionary measures were not taken for at-risk groups, (hence the strategy to ""flatten the curve"" was a good one), but the left never covers the science on this. The left never talks about the media censorship of scientists who oppose their preferred, politicized agenda to characterize the virus as extremely dangerous, hence justifying indefinite lockdowns. (Discontent has traditionally always hurt an incumbent in an election year, and the establishment, both Democrat and global, have been stirring up all the discontent they can.)

Also, a reminder that the virus mortality rate is well under 1% for people under the age of 30, and not much worse for those over the age of 30. In fact, the average age of mortality for the corona virus is something like 74, which is basically the same as the general mortality rate. What this means is that corona, like many other conditions/diseases, takes people when they are old and vulnerable. In other words, those who said from the beginning that the risk of death from corona virus is basically the same as an aggressive flu were correct.

The toilet paper shortage started because of a massive shift in people shitting at work now shitting at home, causing an equally massive increase in purchasing volume for the residential market.

This then became self-perpetuating and led to **actual** hoarding behaviour of course.

But the idea that tons of people started panic buying TP the instant the pandemic started is a myth.

So forgive me but I disagree with the notion that we needed to be lied to about masks in the beginning for our own good.

2020-11-01 19:09:41,gaths9y,t3_jm46mu,McKoijion,t1_gastves,I used to have a much higher opinion of Americans before Trump showed up and revealed the truth.

24/7?  nobody recommends that even now

wearing masks when you're in public?  yes, there were health agencies that recommended at the time, the [the Chinese health organization was recommending that at least as of February](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-nhc_masks-76) (and probably earlier if you look harder for citations - I'm merely pointing out that your assertion here is incorrect, not making a strong claim about the earliest organizations to recommend masks).

your claims are false here, there was substantial evidence that pointed to mask wearing being effective at curbing the spread of the disease.  CDC chose to de-emphasize that to prevent a run on masks - they've said as much themselves.  [Fauci himself said it.](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/502890-fauci-why-the-public-wasnt-told-to-wear-masks)

&gt; He also acknowledged that masks were initially not recommended to the general public so that first responders wouldn‚Äôt feel the strain of a shortage of PPE.

&gt; He explained that public health experts ""were concerned the public health community, and many people were saying this, were concerned that it was at a time when personal protective equipment, including the N95 masks and the surgical masks, were in very short supply.‚Äù 

I realize Fauci is a medical giant, but that doesn't mean that he's not capable of acting unethically.  In this case he did.

Again: they should have done what they eventually ended up doing anyway:  tell everyone not to use medical masks, to save them for the professionals, and to make their own.  Telling everyone masks don't work when the science suggests they do is medically unethical."

I find more fault in the Trump administration in failing to monitor the situation in China to determine that there was asymptomatic transmission. Why did Trump dismantle the pandemic response team in 2018? Why didn‚Äôt he try to get in to China to figure out more information about the virus? Why didn‚Äôt he ramp up production of PPE and Testing in the early days, and assemble a network of contact tracers to prevent community spread? Closing travel with China was the right thing to do, but it was ultimately a time buying tool. What did he do with the time that he bought by making that decision?

These are all rhetorical questions, it‚Äôs futile to expect competence from people like these. I just feel so sad. So many lives could have been saved.

Despite repeatedly being publicly criticized by Mr Trump, the veteran public health expert has been widely praised for his handling both of the pandemic, and of the mercurial president.

Dr Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was viewed more positively now than four years ago according to 44 per cent of respondents of a poll commissioned by The Independent from JL Partners.

JL Partners spoke to 1,002 people between 26 October and 28 October. Of those, only 19 per cent said they had a less favorable view of the 79-year-old doctor."

I did not at any point say that he had a 1/6 chance. I was using the die as an *example* of *how probability works*. But okay, let's go with a 4 sided die, since you don't really seem to understand how analogies work:

If you are rolling a 4-sided die and I tell you there's a 3/4 chance you won't roll a 1, if you roll a 1 **I am not wrong**.

You have stated that pollsters 'got it wrong.'

I am attempting to get you to understand the high school level math that explains exactly why they not only didn't 'get it wrong,' but why even making that argument shows that you don't understand what you are talking about."
2020-11-01 20:46:01,gatttur,t3_jm46cj,Nulldoesnotequalzero,t1_gatfhhr,"He absolutely did have a higher than 1/6 chance near election day (a lot had even lower odds for trump). 538 was probably the most realistic at a 29% chance of Trump victory (although they had a higher 36% EC victory in the days leading up). The polls were close in several states and others they got the polling way off. Many averages showed that they were in the margin of error. There were also troubling signals like a decline of African American turnout, the large amount of undecided votes, that Clinton would be a third term democrat, and the huge variation in polling during the race. Yet the consensus was Clinton had a much higher chance than the polling indicated. She definitely had a higher chance than Trump, but there were signals that should have been a heads up the race was closer than people thought (538's articles leading up to election day did a pretty good job on this).

And the effect of the EC is literally the only thing that matters in the US presidential election. It's cool if you predict the popular vote but doesn't matter as much as winning the EC.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In all the modeling by all the pollsters, Clinton won way more often  than not.

This assumes their modeling and approach to modeling was correct which we now know was not the case in some states."
2020-11-01 18:51:28,gatfhhr,t3_jm46cj,EnticingInsouciance,t1_gaterrh,"&gt; What I am saying is they said he had a 1/6 chance when he had more like a 1/3 or even 1/2

But he didn't. He had a very low chance. Clinton won the popular vote (as has been the case for every D candidate for President since 1992, with 2004 as a questionable exception), and the actual vote margin that made the difference was under 100K across a couple of states.

Trump absolutely did not have a high chance of winning--a perfect storm of confounding events came together and just *barely* squeaked it through.

The reason it looks like a larger, and thus more likely, win than it was is because of the effect of the Electoral College on the numbers. The bottom line is that he only barely made it, and it was an unlikely chance. In all the modeling by all the pollsters, Clinton won way more often than not. That doesn't mean the opposite result was ever very likely. Only means that it happened."

So its more like they said he would have a 1/6 chance of him rolling a 4 but he actually had a 1/2 chance of getting an even number. They got it wrong not because they didn't 100% accurately predict the win but because the foundations of their odds were based on wrong assumptions.

The point basically is that at this time, when you don't have the money to do more television ads, it's that moment you have to suddenly bite the bullet and get on news shows with journalists and answer questions that you might not like just to get more exposure and get your message out there. The hard reality is Trump is just doing rallies where he's preaching to his converted, spouting out loads of lies with no platform or ideas for a second term.

Yes, all those people at the rallies are going to vote for him because they are part of a cult. However, these moves are not convincing new people to pick him over Joe Biden."

The West sees Churchill as some apostle of Freedom and democracy, as some saviour. He's nothing more than a cold-blooded and genocidal tyrant to anyone in most of the world. The Bengal famine, caused by British mismanagement made millions starve to death. Hundreds of millions more died in the Indian subcontinent alone as a result of British policies and massacres under him and other prime ministers. He diverted supplies coming to Kolkata to send as stockpiles for the allied forces while Bengalis starved. The same Indians, by the way, died in astronomically higher numbers defending the lands of their oppressors from the Nazis.

His racist comments towards Gandhi and India and the rest are nothing compared to the insane amount of lives lost in one colony alone under his and his predecessors' watch. Their centuries of torturous rule continues to have ramifications till this day while children grow up in the first world blissfully oblivious to their actual, bloody history because their history books don't begin to scratch at the sheer brutality of British rule across the World. They glorify the British empire as some sort of civilising force.

So I'm not surprised that White people worship him and joke about him being the reason for them not having to learn German; it's very typical of the bubble the first World lives in. I know the world was a very different place back then but Trump hasn't killed nearly as many people and destroyed nearly as many cultures and lands. Churchill apologists make me retch however, as does idiots telling people to not dig up old graves.

Please vote out Trump though and oust the Republicans even before demographical changes slowly cause their demise. The world doesn't have that much time."

Eugenics thought was more widespread than people are aware of (usually people just point to Hitler and think that was the extent of it; yet it‚Äôs not) and where did it originate from? Members of academia. 

Not to mention even if an academic work wasn‚Äôt being overtly racist (for the time period; reading old works today it‚Äôs certainly hard to argue it wasn‚Äôt overt), it would reinforce racist beliefs even if that wasn‚Äôt the intention. Reading old books from my grandfather it was routine to see indigenous Americans and other peoples from undeveloped nations being referred to as ‚Äúsavages‚Äù."

The left on the other hand does have identity politics. You should do some research on Stalinism. He used it very well to divide and conquer.

I absolutely agree with you in the difficulties of minorities. More measures need to be put in place to create a level playing field. However marching to a Marxist society won‚Äôt fix this.

Trump has done more in 4 years to help minorities then Obama/Biden. He‚Äôs passed the First Step Act, $250m/yr for HBCUs and the EFS for scholarship programs. A great start and he‚Äôll do even more if re-elected. 

Biden is most famous for his 1994 Violent Crime Bill. Locked up hundreds of thousands of blacks over the last few decades. Is on record of saying young black men are ‚Äúsuper predators.‚Äù And they say Trump is racist.

i think a large part of the secret voters are probably not those going to the rallies. theyre people who might be from dem families or from dem neighbourhoods.

and even those that go to rallies are more likely to lie or not do polls.

&gt; 2.	‚Å†Biden and his supporters embrace social distancing and believe in the preservation of human life, so no, they are not congregating during a pandemic- you see Biden‚Äôs embrace of science is what may win him the election (again, we will see).

this may be part of it. but i reckon he doesnt have as much of a fanatical base. trump really plays on nationalism and a lot of people really get into it.

It will take time to count all the mail-in votes. Most of them will be votes for biden, since Trump tells his supportes for months not to vote by mail.

On election night it will look like Trump won the election, since the mail-in votes are not yet counted. He will declare himself as winner and will try to do everything (together with his enables in the senate and supreme court) to stop the mail-in votes to be counted.

*If* he doesn't manage to prevent that from happening, he'll try to create the myth of the stolen election. Imagine his voice saying:

""I won on the election night - everybody saw it. It was a great win, maybe even the biggest in our history. And now the democrats are trying to steal the election by altering the results"".

The only chance is to win a landslide for Biden already on Nov 3rd - which I hope happens and proves my theorie wrong."

It‚Äôll ultimately be turned over to Kamala who is further left then Bernie. 

I don‚Äôt disagree with your reasoning on the polls. Absolutely they adjusted their formulas after 2016. But at the end of the day, a shy Trump voter is not going to respond to a pollster. With no data on that key segment, assumptions made by the pollsters will skew it one way versus the other. 

I haven‚Äôt seen that. If you have the link I‚Äôd be curious to check it out. I would just say that more times then not, conservatives are censored more then democrats. I don‚Äôt think anyone disagrees that big tech in Silicon Valley is overwhelming democratic. There is a bias (deserved or not) against conservative thinking. I agree with you that misinformation needs to be withheld. However, who gets to decide what is misinformation? If the team handling those decisions see things through a liberal lens, it‚Äôs a given that conservative views will be censored the most. 

Funny things is I used to be a democrat. Voted Obama and wanted Bernie back in 2016. But as vile as Trump can be in his rhetoric, it doesn‚Äôt compare to that of the Democratic Party. If you take the super small minority of the far Right f***s out (KKk, proud boys, etc) most conservatives are great people who love this country. They love blacks, Hispanics and lgbt joining their cause and welcome them with open arms. But as a white straight male, I was the enemy in my own party.

1. Yes, absolutely agreed. I would say the ‚Äúshy‚Äù Trump voters are no longer shy. They are committing 100%. However they do track the attendance of these rallies. Around 20% are attended by registered Democrats: 
https://bongino.com/heres-why-im-convinced-the-polls-are-wrong-even-more-so-than-four-years-ago

2. This one I‚Äôm torn on. I absolutely agree the Democrats take the virus more seriously. So I agree with the rally size. However, as serious as the virus is, Republicans place more value on Freedom of Speech (Twitter, FB, Google censorship). They are showing up in droves bc we know this is our last stand. Big tech wants to emulate the social credit system we see in China. If we lose the presidency and Senate, I think you‚Äôll have a different opinion in a few years after the fallout. 

3. Absolutely agreed. But the recent poll in Iowa doesn‚Äôt look good. One thing I‚Äôm very curious about is why is Obama and Biden in Minnesota? That should be a blue state like WA or Oregon. If they weren‚Äôt concerned, they wouldn‚Äôt be there.

They are certainly not. In fact, with the recent bad polls for Theresa Greendfield in Iowa, they're not far from retaining control of the senate.

Gideon's narrow lead has also deteriorated a bit in Maine lately. Fortunately for Democrats, Cunningham's also narrow lead in NC is stable, but still too close.

These races are absolutely crucial for Democrats, because Bullock in Montana and Ossoff and Warnock in Georgia have an uphill battle ahead."

2020-11-01 15:37:55,gastbko,t3_jm37ri,TrumpizzaTraitor,t3_jm37ri,"WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Senate Republicans are fighting to save their majority, a final election push against the onslaught of challengers in states once off limits to Democrats but now hotbeds of a potential backlash to President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill.

Fueling the campaigns are the Trump administration‚Äôs handling of the COVID-19 crisis, shifting regional demographics and, in some areas, simply the chance to turn the page on the divisive political climate.

Control of the Senate can make or break a presidency. With it, a reelected Trump could confirm his nominees and ensure a backstop against legislation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Without it, Joe Biden would face a potential wall of opposition to his agenda if the Democratic nominee won the White House.

In North Carolina, for example, the match-up between GOP Sen. Thom Tillis and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham, among the most expensive in the nation, is close.

‚ÄúAt some point, you put it in the hands of voters,‚Äù said Dallas Woodhouse, a former executive director of the state‚Äôs Republican Party.

Republican incumbents are straining for survival from New England to the Deep South, in the heartland and the West and even Alaska. Overpowered in fundraising and stuck in Washington until just last week to confirm Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee, they are fanning out some alongside Trump for last-ditch, home-state tours to shore up votes.

With the chamber now split, 53-47, three or four seats will determine Senate control, depending on which party wins the White House. The vice president breaks a tie in Senate votes.

What started as a lopsided election cycle with Republicans defending 23 seats, compared with 12 for Democrats, quickly became a more stark referendum on the president as Democrats reached deeper into Trump country and put the GOP on defense.

Suddenly some of the nation‚Äôs better-known senators ‚Äî Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, Susan Collins in Maine ‚Äî faced strong reelection threats. Only two Democratic seats are being seriously contested, while at least 10 GOP-held seats are at risk.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how we hold it,‚Äù said Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist in South Carolina who opposes the president.

Felkel added: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be hard pressed to admit we don‚Äôt have a Trump problem.‚Äù

The political landscape is quickly changing from six years ago when most of these senators last faced voters. It‚Äôs a reminder of how sharp the national mood has shifted in the Trump era.

Younger voters and more minorities are pushing some states toward Democrats, including in Colorado, where the parties have essentially stopped spending money for or against GOP Sen. Cory Gardner because it seems he is heading toward defeat by Democrat John Hickenlooper, a former governor.

In more Republican-friendly terrain, the GOP senators must balance an appeal to Trump‚Äôs most ardent supporters with outreach to voters largely in suburbs who are drifting away from the president and his tone .

Tillis is struggling to gain ground in North Carolina, a presidential battleground, even after Cunningham‚Äôs sex-texting scandal with an aide.

Arizona could see two Democratic senators for the first time since last century if former astronaut Mark Kelly maintains his advantage over GOP Sen. Martha McSally for the seat held by the late Republican John McCain.

A vivid dynamic is in Iowa, a state Trump won in 2016 but is now a toss-up as Sen. Joni Ernst struggles to fend off Democrat newcomer Theresa Greenfield. Ernst wowed Republicans with a 2014 debut ad about castrating hogs but she faced criticism after last month‚Äôs debate when she stumbled over the break-even price for soybeans.

In Georgia, Trump calls David Perdue his favorite senator among the many who have jockeyed to join his golf outings and receive his private phone calls. But the first-term senator faces a surge of new voters in the state and Democrat Jon Ossoff is playing hardball.

Ossoff called Pedue a ‚Äúcrook‚Äù over the senator‚Äôs stock trades during the pandemic. Perdue shot back that the Ossoff would do anything to mislead Georgians about Democrats‚Äô ‚Äúradical and socialist‚Äù agenda.

Democrats have tapped into what some are calling a ‚Äúgreen wave‚Äù ‚Äî a new era of fundraising ‚Äî as small-dollar donations pour in from across the country from Americans expressing their political activism with their pocketbooks.

Graham‚Äôs challenger in South Carolina, Jamie Harrison, has raised so much money ‚Äî some $100 million ‚Äî that it sent the top Trump ally scrambling to take the race seriously. Graham swiftly raked in his own record haul as he led the Senate confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.

Competitive races are underway in Republican strongholds of Texas, Kansas and Alaska where little known Al Gross broke state records, Democrats said, in part with viral ads introducing voters to the military-veteran-turned-doctor who once fought off a grizzly bear.

Swooping in to fill the gap for Republicans is the Senate Leadership Fund, tapping deep-pocketed donors. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has funneled more than $60 million to help Republicans hold the Senate.

Over the weekend, the fund was pouring $4.6 million to one of the rare Republican bright spots ‚Äî in Michigan, where John James, a Black Republican businessman is gaining on Democratic Sen. Gary Peters.

‚ÄúWe see a potential opportunity,‚Äù said Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law.

The only other state where Republicans are playing offense is Alabama, where Democratic Sen. Doug Jones pulled off a rare special election win the Trump stronghold but now wages a longshot campaign against Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn football coach.

‚ÄúWe are confident heading into the home stretch because we remain on offense is so many seats across the country,‚Äù said Stewart Boss, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

The COVID crisis has shadowed the Senate races as Democrats linked Trump‚Äôs handling of the pandemic to the GOP‚Äôs repeated attempts to undo the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, particularly its insurance protections for those with preexisting medical conditions. Republicans fired back that Democrats want to keep the economy closed, hurting jobs.

David Flaherty, a Colorado-based Republican pollster, said his surveys are showing that COVID will be ‚Äúthe most likely issue many voters will make their decisions on.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn more places in the country than not, the president is not getting good marks‚Äù on that, Flaherty said, and it‚Äôs damaging Senate GOP candidates, ‚Äúespecially those in lockstep with the president.‚Äù

Several races may drag well past election night including if no candidate secures a majority, including in Georgia or Maine, where Collins was once considered among the most independent senators, is now confronting critics from the right and left.

Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee said the races are tightening in the final days.

‚ÄúWe always knew this was going to be a competitive election cycle,‚Äù he said.

Remember the pledge of allegiance to the flag?  One nation. With liberty and justice for all.  

Donald Trump has taken that away from America.  There is no **for all** any longer. Separation and division is not making America ""great"".  

In my lifetime, America was only ""great"" right after 9/11.  People gave a fuck about their fellow man and for a moment in time we actually all had mutual respect and admiration for one another.  Shortly after 9/11 I remember driving to work and an ambulance came down the road.  Both sides, every single car on a divided highway moved all the way to the shoulder of the road, like I had never seen before.  Years later, admittedly not the greatest thing to say, an acquaintance and I would say, ""We need another 9/11"", to reset America again; Americans started to become selfish, entitled, angry, etc.  The ambulance seen fights through traffic now and people hesitate to move to the side to let the ambulance by.  You can confirm this even more today with your own eyes. 

I hope another 9/11 scenario does not happen, but I would welcome the much needed reset of America's dignity, respect, compassion, fairness, truth, morality, ethics, law, order, the list could go on, for fellow man.

Please vote.  Whatever your political affiliation, please vote.  Maybe the voter turnout will send a message to leaders that people are paying attention.  Please vote and let your voice be heard."

That Trump managed to eek out just enough votes, in just enough states, to nail-down a win always smacked more of Russian Interference/District Level fuckery/Yet another ""red alert"" news article re: how easily these newfangled e-voting machines can be hacked that was summarily ignored than a last-minute ground swell of morons flocking to the voting booth. 

The exit polls never matched up, and we can clearly see contemporary evidence of the GOP being willing to do whatever they fuck they think they can get away with in order to suppress/steal the vote."

Then is office units in NYC. Which has been pounded by work from home becoming the norm. Vacancies through the roof. Again driving down what was extremely sought after property. 

He has little to no liquid assets to cover the debt, and is likely bleeding money hand over fist because of covid destroying the hospitality industry. 

He he has no hope of paying it back without selling a bunch of stuff. And in the current climate I don‚Äôt know if his assets cover the debt. 

Unless he can get some Russians or Saudis to overpay for his properties there is a good chance this leads to him being personally bankrupt. 

On the off chance he does cover the debts. He now has a tiny portfolio a fraction of the size it once was. And likely only containing properties that are still bleeding money.

2020-11-01 13:34:20,gashj0f,t3_jm1xcg,athornton79,t3_jm1xcg,"Let's see... to summarize some of the many reasons:


1) He's bankrupt. As soon as he's out of office (or during if he somehow wins), his debts come due. Despite his image, he does not have a billion dollars laying around to pay off his debts. Nor will ANY reputable lending group loan him the money. He can always go back to the Russian mob of course, but they may not be so encouraged to do business with him given the microscope he's going to be under. So.. he'll be broke. 

2) State Crimes/Prison. He is already facing multiple criminal charges in New York and elsewhere due to his taxes, his illegal misuse of his charity organizations and numerous other crimes. Those are STATE level crimes too. SO he (nor Pence if he resigns) cannot pardon him for those. Once he's out from under his magic 'I'm President so you cannot charge me!' cloak, he's done. And he knows it. Hence his comment recently that ""if Biden wins, I may have to leave the country"". He knows he'll have to flee or face serious jail time!

3) Federal Crimes/Prison. He has violated so many FEDERAL laws at this point its a joke. And the GOP happily let him skate without even wagging their finger at him. Look at the joke of an impeachment trial the Senate held. They had him dead to rights - despite the White House refusal to turn over additional materials or testimony from LAWFUL SUBPOENAS. And the Senate refused to follow up at all. No additional evidence gathering authorized. No additional witnesses (who had previously refused to testify). IT was a sham and everyone knows it. But the GOP (and their mindless follows) cheered on the shitting on of the Constitution. ""Totally Exonerated"". Once a respectable DOJ is in place then all that evidence can finally be pulled to light. Charges THEN will NOT go through the Senate but the courts. Of course, the GOP has been packing those left &amp; right as insurance, but hopefully that can be dealt with as a separate matter. Trump's only possible saving grace there is if he attempts to Self Pardon (something that's iffy at best) or resigns and let's Pence pardon him - a very real possibility. That would negate this aspect, but only to a point as...

4) Treason. While the whole Mueller report showed clearly (and was ACKNOWLEDGED) in the GOP controlled Senate report that Russia DID interfere in 2016 on Trump's behalf AND there was an unusually HIGH amount of communication between top individuals in Trump's campaign and those same Russians, there was no DIRECT proof Trump made any decisions or directed things on his end. However! Trump and others deliberately blocked routes of investigation, refused testimony and refused to hand over key evidence. Basically they obstructed. Again, the GOP happily let it slide though. If that matter is FULLY fleshed out and its proven Trump DID know personally about Russia's aid and if he even ASKED for such help? That is flat out treason. Of course, the GOP would again be reluctant to go against him (as it damns them too), but that's another potential worry for Trump. Slim at best, admittedly, but still a possibility. And that threat could be what Russia is dangling over his head to keep him in line too. If anything else has been proven in the past four years, its that Trump cares about one thing above all else: Himself."

Even if he loses the election the Republican system will try by all means not to have him punished. They have influenced the courts, police and investigators. If he is found guilty of any of his crimes, he will get the minimum required punishment 

Worse his supporters will collectively have a psychotic break. Just look at how crazy Q Anon has become. You think they are gonna just let Papa Trump suffer for his actions?"

My holding a tacticool equipment ‚Äúshow and tell‚Äù meeting does not a militia make.  Even if we assemble in a Denny‚Äôs parking lot and then car pool to our protest together...  still not a militia.  Even if we come up with a catchy icon and have some patches made and assign each other catchy call signs like ‚ÄúMaverick 2‚Äù or ‚ÄúViper One Five‚Äù...  STILL not a militia.

Absent elected civilian oversight, there is nothing, literally not one thing an armed group can do that does not constitute being a terrorist.

We have to insist that the press stop calling these groups ‚Äúmilitias.‚Äù  I totally get that the press is afraid of the potential backlash, not unlike the backlash the French press get from calling out extremist Islamic terrorists.  But it‚Äôs a risk that has to be taken.  These terror cells in the US are being given an air of credibility and legitimacy by calling them militias.  They are identical in form and tactic to ISIS, not to the original minutemen."
2020-11-01 18:15:12,gataydp,t3_jm10o7,xDulmitx,t1_gasajic,"Most people deeply abhore violence.  Sure they may play violent, but few people are normally willing to kill others who are not attempting to kill them.  I think you will see a few isolated incidents no matter who wins (and each will be deeply tragic).  People also underestimate the number of left leaning people who own guns.  What I think is likely is a few isolated incidents of killings performed by troubled individuals or small groups of people.  You are likely to see a decent amount of property damage though since destroying a car or building is not as against our general nature.  This does mean that cities will tend to be more vulnerable, but I think the actual loss of life will be low.


God I hope it doesn't get to actual shooting back though.  People will kill to defend themselves and once shooting starts and is answered everyone feels like they are defending themselves.  Property damage is bad, but things can be replaced or fixed: death is forever."
2020-11-01 18:07:41,gata1rq,t3_jm10o7,SkyKing36,t1_gasxwp9,"‚ÄúLaw and order‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean what you think it means.  ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù is a moniker placed on candidates or movements that favor the use of the police and courts to enforce a class structure rather than simply enforce the law.  A ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù candidate wants the police to act behind the scenes to protect one cultural group from encroachment by other cultural groups, NOT protect the innocent from criminals.

‚ÄúRule of Law‚Äù and ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù are opposites, not synonyms.  The funny thing is that ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù candidates brag openly about being ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù candidates rather than being ‚ÄúRule of Law‚Äù candidates, a dog whistle signal to those who believe that one role of government is to protect ‚Äúour heritage‚Äù from the notion that all are created equal.

Fact:  The DOJ and FBI arrested and changed members of a right-wing conspiracy group, one of these so-called ‚ÄúMilitias‚Äù with being the ones who exploited the peaceful George Floyd protests.  The people who started the violence, and actually entered the 3rd precinct police HQ and burned it down, starting the rioting across the nation, were actually activists from the ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù party."
2020-11-01 18:07:02,gat9z48,t3_jm10o7,Gari_305,t1_gat8w3r,"It's not the existence of the militia that is in question but the legality of the militia. 

My point is the following: 

If the City Council, has the authority to form a militia then how could they be labeled a terrorist organization? 

If the Governor has the authority to organized a militia (not solely the National Guard) then how can that be considered a terrorist organization? 

Now can a militia do terrorist acts, yes. However, they can also perform paramilitary activities also, thus militias are more akin to a paramilitary force than a terrorist organization or a gang.

Do some research on the culture within the Minneapolis Police Department and how openly and brazenly  union rep Bob Kroll tells the city government to mind their own business and stay out of police governance.  What you will find is a cancerous problem that cannot simply be fixed by a Biden victory.  Minneapolis has had both an openly lesbian woman and now a black man as its police chief and neither have been able to affect any meaningful reform because the department maintains its own shadow leadership structure.  Even under Obama the DOJ consent decrees were a painful compromise stop gap measure, that fall far short of citizens really having meaningful control of their policing culture."

That is so cute, that you looked at a snippet and gives you comfort however, out here in the real world militias can be terrorists but are more like paramilitaries especially since the following: 

1. Warren County of Virginia debate for the [forming of citizen militias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAInT65c5gg)

3. Governors can and are able to use unorganized militias more so than National Guard Militias as seen [here](https://www.cfr.org/article/what-are-laws-governing-military-force-during-us-elections)

2020-11-01 12:24:40,gasbyxb,t3_jm10o7,Gari_305,t1_gasbpg8,"&gt; By definition, they are not. 

[By definition they are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia) \- Militia -  is generally an [army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army) or **some other** [**fighting organization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_organization) **of non-**[**professional**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional) **soldiers**, **citizens of a country**, or subjects of a state, who may perform military service during a time of need, as opposed to a professional force of [regular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_army), full-time [military personnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_personnel), or (historically) to members of a warrior [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility) class (e.g. [knights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight) or [samurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai)). **Generally unable to hold ground against regular forces**, militias commonly support regular troops by [skirmishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirmisher), holding fortifications, or **conducting** [**irregular warfare**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_warfare), instead of undertaking offensive campaigns by themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

In short you need to study up on militias fast, otherwise how can you defeat an enemy you don't understand basic terminology of your opponent?"
2020-11-01 12:22:18,gasbt6g,t3_jm10o7,masksrequired,t1_gasb6nn,Nope. These are terrorist organizations.
2020-11-01 12:20:43,gasbpg8,t3_jm10o7,mdwstoned,t1_gasb6nn,"By definition,  they are not. As i understand it, militias are supposed to be regulated by the state. These small penis domestic terrorists are not."

It's a problem. There isn't a mainstream news network, including Fox News, that Trump and his followers will trust. They won't trust anyone who says Trump lost. And we know that these kind of people, like the ones that surrounded the Biden/Harris campaign bus, aren't exactly rational people."

I think we would have seen more shenanigans by now given the high turnout for early voting. There may be pockets of trouble on Tuesday but I don‚Äôt think it will be at a large scale. I think they risk scaring off their own potential voters if they promote violent confrontations. They‚Äôre counting on a high turnout of undecided and first time voters breaking for Trump. A lot of people may say fuck it if there appears to be chaos at polling centres. Where we might see trouble is around places tallying votes post Election Day because this was an effective strategy to stop the count early in 2000.

Arbitration is possible big usually that is handled by lawyers, because arbitration has to abide by the law of the land.
Insofar as there are laws, we need people who know it well. Specialization is a good thing. We cannot all know everything. We can redefine what a lawyer can do or not do, but that is a matter for the legislature, not attorneys. They don‚Äôt create the law. 
Having been in a jury, I would absolutely not trust juries as the sole source of justice. I will give you an example that terrified me. A plaintiff claimed that a subcontractor had to pay compensation because all the contracts they had had with them, which were all identical, so established. In this particular case, out of easily thirty hires, the plaintiff couldn‚Äôt find the piece of paper that said that for this particular situation.
Imagine that you are told everyday before having dinner to wash your hands. You do it. All is fine. One day your parents forget to tell you. Now you claim you don‚Äôt have to wash your hands, because they didn‚Äôt tell you to. That argument is childish and, according to jurisprudence, inaccurate. Repetitive practice establishes a pattern of conduct that is binding.
My example to the jury during deliberation was that if a college professor tells you every single time that your homework must be double-spaced, but there was one instance in which she didn‚Äôt remind you, the logical assumption is that, in absence of new instructions, the old instructions apply.
My co-juror, a doctoral student from an Ivy League school who also taught, said to me, ‚ÄúWe are the jury. We are not lawyers.‚Äù So, to her, being a lawyer meant having common sense, whereas being a jury is using a toddler‚Äôs reasoning.

A prime example of this would be two twin girls who were considered the poster children for the KKK. They would attend rallies with their parents, sing songs about killing minorities, sometimes even using vulgar language, and whatever things the KKK does.

However, the eventually had to start school and being your ""average"" family in the US, they sent their children to public school. A public school filled not only with whites but a decent population of minorities, as well.

Now they're approaching their teen years and they want nothing to do with the KKK. They have friends who are minorities and are well loved by their classmates because of how accepting they've become of others outside their race.

2020-11-01 19:53:27,gatn9an,t3_jm0v2f,RedditOfUnusualSize,t1_gasxcj8,"Eh, I'd say it's simpler than that: lawyers are generally only accountable to other lawyers.

I mean that quite literally: the entity that polices attorney misconduct is generally the state bar association, not a state entity. The historical relationship between guilds and the state is a fascinating one, which I am mostly unfamiliar with, but a shorthand version of its present condition in America is that direct state supervision is for guilds that meet two requirements: 1) associated with poor and working-class professions, and 2) are politically lacking in power. Hairdressers? It's not uncommon for them to have to follow an explicit state licensing program. Teachers and police officers? Their unions are usually strong enough to keep most direct government attention at bay in practice, but they do have some explicit governmental oversight.

But attorneys and medical doctors? No, they are almost never subject to direct government sanction for misconduct. The measure is not ""how much damage they can do""; a doctor committing systematic malpractice or a judge that accepts bribes can do incalculable damage to their respective systems. What matters is how connected they are within the political system. And attorneys? For the most part, they *are* the system.

This means, practically speaking, that there are three basic circumstances wherein attorneys receive sanction from their fellow attorneys. One, when the attorney does something so public, that the rest of their fellow attorneys might look bad by association. Two, when a zealous member of the state bar association takes it upon themselves to prosecute and discipline an errant attorney. And three, when an attorney in the state bar association has a real fucking grudge against a fellow attorney, so much so that they will take the time to make it their personal mission to destroy that other attorney.

As you might imagine, despite Circumstance Two being far and away the ideal for attorney conduct, it is also far and away the least-likely of the three. Attorney associations will outright steer people who might be inclined to such zealous defense of the law away from those professions, and hiring committees won't accept them even if they apply. The state OPC's and bar association reviews? Usually a joke as a consequence, and usually motivated less by clear evidence of malpractice than by a desire to perform bargain basement public relations."

How can you say you realise how important the legal profession is and then say it doesn't do anything for the good of humanity? Hospitals need lawyers, charities do, immigrants seeking assistance, anyone wrong seeking justice.  As well say electricians never do any good. Anywhere you need laws, you need solicitors to represent the best interests of people trying to operate within the scope of them, to mediate disputes, for example.  Unless you are suggesting we would be better off without a transparent, robust legal system? 

You don't need to attack me personally. I've not done so to you. You made a single sweeping, ill considered comment and I called you out on it. I am criticising your comment.

After that, they can start with re-introducing what the house did this past term, which includes things like a new voting rights act (which probably needs new things added around mail in voting), 15 dollar minimum wage, anti-lgbtqia discrimination, justice in policing, violence against women act, gun control, etc. I think they passed partisan bills (because we don't need or want republican input) on many of the most pressing issues this term. It may have been ""pointless"" (as I saw many say) because they wouldn't pass the senate, but they showed us what their values are and what they will do once they have power again, and now they have real bills to pass as soon as they can.

Also, ending the filibuster is no question first thing. I don't think that requires anything other than the leader saying it's ended, though. It's not in the constitution and there was never a vote on judicial filibuster. So after that, they also have to give DC statehood immediately and offer it to Puerto Rico so they can hold a vote ASAP. Also, enact the Wyoming Rule. I guess it should be end filibuster, Heroes Act, DC statehood, Wyoming rule, and then start with the 2019-2020 term bills.

During the period before he's inaugurated, Biden needs to create a team and set up an exact plan for covid the moment he takes office. I don't know if he can work with Fauci before he takes office, but I hope so. I assume they already have a relationship from dealing with swine flu and ebola. Then when he takes office, he needs to immediately act on that plan. I assume this will include the defense production act to make n95 masks for all essential workers. There still aren't even enough for hospitals. Teachers, bus drivers, grocery workers, etc should have them. 

Then he needs to start undoing Trump's executive orders and releasing anything that Trump hid to the public. Rejoin things he has pulled us from or repair relations with things he has threatened like Paris climate accord, WHO, NATO, etc. He should also speak with our allies, and start putting America behind support for democracy worldwide like in Belarus and Thailand. 

But Covid-19 relief and a plan is the most important thing day 1

Gorsuch should never even have been an issue because what McConnell and his Senate did was an abuse of their office. That one was their violation of duty. 

What makes the 3 appointments illegitimate are McConnell blocking Garland's nomination, and the fact that Trump won the presidency via deception and cheating. Even if you use Trump's defense that he didn't collude, and Russia cheated for him without his knowledge (which we all know is bullshit), it's still cheating. And that also applies to all the cheating Republicans did in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, etc. where voters were removed from the voting rolls, polls were so limited that huge numbers of people were unable to vote, votes were rejected without legitimate reasons, voters were intimidated and lied to about where and when to vote, etc.

In some ways, the problem lies at the root of what lawyers are supposed to do. It is a Bedrock principle the legal profession that everyone deserves zealous representation. That means to represent clients to the fullest of your ability within the confines of the law, even if you disagree with what they have done personally. Even if you find it repugnant.

The theory is that everyone deserves representation. By separating yourself personally from the issues, you are able to provide legal representation for people that otherwise likely would not get it. Such as people accused of murder or rape or other heinous crimes.  Or morally bankrupt people like Donald Trump. The problem in practice of course, is that those with the most money can afford lawyers that will tie matters up in court for years or make unethical decisions, which actually undermines justice.

So in my opinion, the problem is systemic. There's nothing inherently wrong with lawyers representing people that are awful individuals. The problem lies in the system itself. It should not be possible to tie up an issue in court for years or decades and escape Justice. But this is common. 

That said, the law does attract many unethical individuals that have no issue making dubious legal arguments.

So tldr - many lawyers are probably bad guys, but the situation is made worse because the system encourages shenanigans."

But things like ex parte communications with the adjudicating body behind the scenes while proceedings are ongoing, that is something a lawyer can be sanctioned for.

Also not providing evidence in their sole possession that contradicts what they have said, is not allowed, ""breach of the duty of candor to the tribunal"".

What the lawyers provide in written affirmations under oath, they shouldn't lie in there, but any lies told while stand-up litigating in a courtroom are pretty much immune from prosecution."

2020-11-01 14:15:07,gasl80g,t3_jm0v2f,Rockman507,t1_gaset7j,"You have to look at the rules regarding impeachment. Anything to deal with the cages would be fairly murky as to some degree the policies were active under Obama and the Trump team can make a legitimate claim they are trying to track down families (since they didn‚Äôt keep records it‚Äôs a valid and understandable problem). Ignoring subpoenas is a flimsy angle. So you have three main cases for impeachment: (1) Treason, (2) Bribery, and (3) high crimes and misdemeanors. 

1.	 Treason legally defined is notoriously hard to pin and really requires some act of war declared. Given that I went down a list ages ago of people charged with Treason, and believe it was under 20, and all but 1 or 2 were tossed or eventually forgiven. One not forgiven was because they immediately hung the guy.
2.	This would be the ding ding ding. It‚Äôs pretty clear cut legally and we had the evidence. But aside from an ‚ÄúOath‚Äù the Senators aren‚Äôt mandated by anything except their own re-elections to take seriously. Any Senator voting to convict Trump was signing off the end of their political careers.
3.	And this one is tricky. Technically the term is rooted in the British legal and is fairly well defined there but leads to the discussion that the terms should be used as intended at the time of writing. Which just means you can poke lots of holes if you really wanted to. Fuck, we impeached a Judge for being intoxicated too often. Unless you really piss off both sides, this won‚Äôt go anywhere. If you do piss off both sides.... well apparently drinking is enough to get you kicked.

Bribery was the best case, and introducing a wide range of Articles of Impeachment would have just given the other side more to run around screaming how unfair this was. If they didn‚Äôt make it short and sweet, the messaging would get lost. It wasn‚Äôt dirt against Biden, it was bribing a foreign power. They knew he wouldn‚Äôt get convicted. So ‚Äúlook at the bribes, look at (insert senator here) allow it‚Äù. 

Still stupid, the dems had to do something or lose their seats for people more to the left. So end of the day, it did turn into political theatre."

With only 2 days until the election is over, please do everything you can to increase voter turnout. Let's put in the work now so we can wake up on November 4th with a smile on our face.

- Vote [(all the info to do so is here)](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote)
- Encourage family and friends to vote
- Offer anyone you know who may need one a ride to the polls, offer to be an escort to the polls if they are too shy or nervous to go alone, offer any help you can
- Get a group of friends together (wearing masks) and vote together. This is a good way to get your least likely to vote friends to actually vote this year
- Join a phone bank to help increase voter turnout on a national level (Google can help you find these)

[Know your voting rights](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights/) in case they are challenged."

The reason I say this is because right now it just goes into treasury bonds and barely collects any interest. Let me describe it all with finance math

Say I have $1,000,000 and I leave it compounding annually for 25 years at a rate of 3% APY (what treasuries yield)...After 25 years it would be $2,093,777.93.... which sounds ok but it kinda isn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs inflation levels honestly

So let‚Äôs say we create a portfolio that‚Äôs diversified and is in some stocks and some bonds that yields around 6%, well $1,000,000 in 25 years becomes $4,291,870... a way better return

Now I‚Äôm not going to bullshit you, an all stock portfolio might not actually be a bad idea (remember that social security is a fund that is only really growing because there is a surplus of money, meaning what Americans are paying into it is more than what is being withdrawn. So the people who need it in the short term are already taken care of).... if we did an all stock portfolio and got a 9% yield over 25 years (It‚Äôs typically higher in the long run but I will work with 9%) that turns our $1,000,000 into $8,623,080.... even if hypothetically there was a crash that cut it in half, you‚Äôd be left with more than twice what you‚Äôd have being 100% in treasuries... 

please also note that when I say 9% returns that I‚Äôm including all previous stock market crashes, it‚Äôs just more advantageous... a good example would be that even if you invested at the highest point stocks were at in 2008 before that crash (using the S&amp;P500 for reference) you would today have a 107% gain, and that‚Äôs after the Great Recession and the crash from this year"

You could have googled this just as easily.

Keep in mind this is adjusted income after taking the standard deduction as well.

The [standard tax deduction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeduction.asp#:~:text=2021%20Standard%20Deduction%20Amounts&amp;text=%2412%2C550%20for%20single%20taxpayers,for%20married%20taxpayers%20filing%20jointly $12,400) for individual which means you must make over that amount before you pay anything.

$24,800 if married and filling jointly."

We can print $0.4T to flre place the lost income from a 6 month SSI holiday. And if it's 6 months we won't lose half a years SSI taxes of we structure it so you pay on $x worth of income instead of your first $x worth of income.

2020-11-01 17:02:33,gat2l4o,t3_jm0knq,AHans,t1_gat0fl8,"Probably very few.

Most people who are covered by employer sponsored health insurance are skilled labor.  We generally know what we're worth (even if some of us are under paid).

My employer sponsored health insurance is not ""my money"", and it's a great tax-free perk.  There's a lot of misunderstanding about that.

Nonetheless, it **is** part of my compensation package.  If you cut my employer sponsored health insurance, I would demand a comparable increase in pay, or I'd go job hunting.  When considering a job, I look at my net benefits, and the projected hours I'd need to work; and make a comparison.

If two jobs offer me the same salary; and one job includes employer sponsored insurance, there's almost no decision to be made, barring other remarkable circumstances.

If one job offers me a $15,000 additional annual salary, but does not have an employer sponsored plan, then I have a decision to make.

I'd still rather see everyone insured through Medicare, so I'd rather see the money go there.  But my net compensation needs to fall between $80,000 - $120,000; based on my experience, education, industry, and the region / locality.

If you pay me $70,000, plus you throw in: employer sponsored health ins, retirement, income continuation, and generous vacation, I consider the $80,000 threshold met and I will consider the job.  As an employer, you get some tax deductions for this too.

If you pay me $110,000, but I need to fund that earlier list using the $110,000 annual salary, that's okay with me too (except vacation)

If you pay me $170,000, but I don't get the vacation, that's an acceptable trade off as well.

If the first job takes those perks away and tries to just pay me $70,000, I'll take a different job which pays closer to $110,000; but doesn't offer those perks."

Medicare is a bit of a problem; because health costs have grown exponentially since around the 80's.  If the curve doesn't flatten, 1.45% (2.9% total) may not be enough to fund medical coverage properly.

The ACA's expansion of the Medicare tax to the wealthy was probably a good start; but I'm in favor of switching to Medicare for All.

Increase my tax rate by a flat 7% (hell 10%) but let me stop carrying private health insurance; have my employer remit the ""employer sponsored"" portion of my medical insurance to the federal Government, and get me on the Medicare rolls.

The [Paul] Ryan plan addressed the growth a different way.  They want to give you a voucher and tell you to buy private insurance.  

That's so insulting I almost don't know where to begin; but for starters - stick your voucher up your ass, Paul Ryan: just give me cash instead.  I'll pass on a ""voucher"" which is insufficient to pay for the entire cost of medical insurance and is a transparent attempt to siphon my tax dollars to a private company for minimal benefit."

All this means, at worst, is that we would have to save and invest your own money. Pay-roll taxes can be any thing you pay tax on, it doesn't *have* to be SoS.

The rationale is that Corona Stimulus was very expensive. Trillions in QE. These cuts can help supplement people's pay while incentivising returning to the labor pool. Its probably cheaper than continuing to pay out extra pandemic-unemployment-insurance, its money the individual produced, and it doesn't inflate the dollar."

You would be surprised how many people donate to political campaigns who really can't afford to. Small amounts of money like $20. And then they don't notice it's recurring for a month or two and end up loosing $200.

When poor grandma can't afford the medicine copay this month because Trump took the money, when a family couldn't buy Christmas presents this year because Trump took the money.

&gt;A number of those investigative threads could ultimately combine into one federal racketeering investigation that could cast his business and charitable entities as elements of a criminal organization that Donald Trump oversaw as kingpin.

&gt;As Trump ascended to the presidency*, more and more allegations have surfaced suggesting that the Trump family businesses have been permeated with fraud.




[David Enrich, NYT Business Editor](https://twitter.com/davidenrich/status/1314592243710296064?s=20) 

&gt;In the midst of the 2016 campaign, @realDonaldTrump was low on cash. Even Deutsche Bank turned him down for a loan. So he engineered a sudden windfall from an unlikely source: Las Vegas. In a series of unusual 2016 transactions, Trump got $21 million from the Vegas hotel he owned with his casino mogul Phil Ruffin. After the election, Ruffin met with Trump and won long-sought federal support for an LA-to-Vegas train line.

Every time (38 according to this video!) Trump is asked to ""condemn"" white supremacists or racists, it is because he recently said something racist.

This is kind of like producing a video of Bill Clinton saying ""I did not have sexual relations with"" Monica Lewinsky to show that he isn't a dirty old man."

Trump badly needs help with the black vote which he believed Ice Cube can deliver thus it was worth more of this time. This does not indicate a commitment to provide more than lip service.

Turns out that rich fucks are doing fine no matter the color of their skin and cube is willing to give his endorsement to whomever is willing to give him face time which is shameful given trumps actual position on black people.

""Suburban women will you pleas like me I saved your neighborhoods"" (from black people)

and who can forget trump pre political career

""Laziness is a characteristic of the black""

""I don't like black people counting my money""

and who can forget Trump the landlord.

""Make sure you don't rent to black people""

You know what black people that are actually hurting need. Health care they can afford which can't be brought about by executive order and can be destroyed by Trumps lawsuit to be heard next on November 10th.

A higher minimum wage which would stand to increase wages across the lower end of the spectrum. Supported by Biden but not Trump.

Not re instituting the food stamp work requirement when many people want to work but can't which the Trump admin would have rolled out 6 months ago if the courts hadn't blocked it.

How about the double whammy of those who face discrimination because they are gay and black. LGBQT issues are black issues too.

How about trump blocking many low wage workers from being eligible for overtime by virtue of working in some supervisory capacity however minimal. This was supposed to go up substantially before trump took office and then well that went away and in 2020 you can be the assistant manager of the taco bell and earn 35,568 and be exempt from overtime. It was supposed to go up to over 50k but when trump rolled in this was withdrawn.

The same trump who has been promising health care for the last 4 years has no incentive to deliver ANYTHING for black people. You can't vote for him again in 2024 because of term limits. Either he ends democracy as we know it or he goes home.

In theory he could work on getting his kid elected but does anyone see THAT happening?"

My instinct is that these things happened *despite* him, not *thanks to* him. A lot of ¬´¬†his¬†¬ª foreign administration still are lifelong public servants, who are skilled at what they do (unlike most his political and loyal appointees).

His public ¬´¬†accomplishments¬†¬ª in foreign policies includes starting trading wars, enabling Putin in various ways (pulling off international treaties, the Syria fiasco I and others mentioned), weakening international institutions such as NATO, WHO...

So yeah... quite hard for me to say this administration has done a good job. I mean if a student gets 3 points out of a 20 point test, do we praise him¬† for doing good on the 3 points he got ?"

The Middle East is a hornet's nest precisely because of history, competing interests, religious and ethic hatred, tribalism and economic exploitation.  The allies and opponents of the various factions switch sides often, for their own reasons and calculations.  UAE and Sudan are not in the center of the Middle East power struggle, and can afford to have a ""peace treaty"" with Israel, because of economic self-interest, not because their ""peace"" contributed to resolving any of the issues.

When the competing claims of the Palestinians and Israelis are resolved in a mutually acceptable manner (and annihilation of one side or the other is not an ""acceptable manner""), then one plank of a lasting peace will be in place.  Another will be the resolutikn between the Sunni and Shiite branches of the Muslim world.  A third plank would be the lessening of competition by the various great powers of the world for the region's resources.

On the latter point, the abandonment of carbon-based energy will probably go a long way to bringing actual peace to the region."

Again, I'm not saying I'm cool with Pence's policies, but if you think he's be as destructive to American discourse to the point of having sharp spikes in rightwing terrorism, you're not understanding how Trump is a ""different politician.""

Look up Tim Scott of South Carolina, which has the same dynamics as the Deep South. He defeated the son of a segregationist (I think Strom Thurmond) and won elections to be a US Senator. 

Heck, his approval rating is much higher than Lindsey Graham, especially among the mostly white Republican base. 

I think that Republicans are open to voting for a black person. They just need to be a Republican and have enough personality and/or policies that resonate with the base. 

And also, I don‚Äôt vote based on a person‚Äôs appearance or status. I vote based on personality and/or policies. 

Also, it‚Äôs difficult for a non-rich person to be elected in office. Campaigns are expensive and are a full-time job. You can‚Äôt tap into most of the voters in your area without enough money and resources."

These are all states that haven't elected a black person to a statewide office since Reconstruction.

Mississippi had the nation's first two black senators after they were chosen by legislators in 1870 rather than popularly elected^(1).

Mississippi - 37.8%

Alabama - 26.8%

Arkansas - 15.7%

Tennessee - 17.1%

So, if these deep red states aren't even open to electing a black person to statewide office, let's not pretend that they are all that open to a black person as president, or any non-white non-rich non-Christian non-male person, for that matter.

2020-11-02 01:45:06,gaurztm,t3_jlxnxp,youreabigbiasedbaby,t1_gasiuop,"&gt;Is there a message here I'm not seeing?

Yep, because there is no message. This is almost certainly happenstance. 

The headline states ""found near"" signs. Sounds bad right? Makes for a scary headline. 

Well, political signs *are everywhere*, like every 10 feet in even somewhat populated areas. Article goes on to state the head was found in a plastic garbage bag. Well that's odd isn‚Äôt it? If someone was trying to be malicious, why wrap it up in a bag? Wouldn't they leave it out in the open and visible? Lay it at the base of the signs? Maybe smear some gore on the sign? Doesn't make much sense. 

Then, consider what time of year it is- deer season. It's a well known practice among piece of shit hunters to ""field dress"" an animal, then dispose of its organs, legs, and head in illegal ways, like dumping them over bridges, into unattended dumpsters, or tossing them on the side of the road."

It's archery season in Iowa, and I've been spending all the hours I can get away in the timber. There's nothing like the serenity of being a part of nature. I love getting to a stand in the dark and watching shapes then colors slowly filter into the world. The birds, squirrels, raccoons, coyotes, and other critters go about their critter business thinking themselves unobserved. I get to watch them and learn their habits. I play the weather and the wind. This year I was able to sneak up on a deer and get it with my bow. I crawled on my belly for an hour. 

And I hunt wild pheasants in Iowa and South Dakota. I've got a Brittany spaniel who's my best friend. I raised him from when he was 7 weeks old, and I trained him myself. He's a hell of a dog, and no joy in the world compares to a bird dog in the field. 

And I'd be lying if I told you there's no thrill when the right buck comes in or a rooster flushes. Hunting is beautiful and brutal. I do all that I can to minimize an animal's suffering and only take shots that I'm confident in. 

Hunters are also the leaders and financiers of the modern conservation movement."

A poacher would only have to worry about the physical evidence versus the paper trail if the deer were killed illegally. 

I assume a forensics specialist paired with the info on the tags for what deer had been recorded as hunted and killed would lead to a general weight level of the head-to-body ratio, which then would at least narrow down suspects.

Trump could even win Pennsylvania with the GOP's current USPS suppression. But then Biden has to win by a large margin in Arizona. The same goes if Biden instead wins Pennsylvania and not Arizona--big margin needed. Any other states he wins are just icing on the cake. On election night, Arizona might be the determining state. If Trump wins Arizona, wait for Pennsylvania.  However, in this scenario, if SCOTUS stops ballot counting in Pennsylvania, we might be screwed. ...again this is all assuming every swing state goes to Trump.

[Link](https://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Reports/An-Evaluation-of-2016-Election-Polls-in-the-U-S.aspx#CONCLUSIONS)  
The evidence for some sort of ""social desirability"" effect when replying to pollsters is weak. The Trafalgar approach of asking ""who are your friends voting for?"" is nonsense, because the /narrative/ of the shy Trump voter is a clear confound.  
Furthermore, studies have shown no difference between a respondent's willingness to say that they will vote for Trump when the poll is conducted by telephone or online. [Link](https://morningconsult.com/form/shy-trump-2020/)  
I recall reading about a survey where people were first asked about their political leanings (R vs D) and then asked about whether they'd respond truthfully to a pollster. This survey found that Rs were less likely to respond truthfully. But again, this is poor methodology, because asking for political leaning primes a certain response to the second question.  
Finally the argument from pro-Trump voters seeking to placate their wife, or lying to their doctor / accountant / priest is completely anecdotal and does not demonstrate that any shy Trump voter effect (even if it were to exist) is of sufficient magnitude to result in Trump actually having a larger vote-share than Biden.  

2. "",The Trafalgar Group‚Äôs Rob Cahaly ‚Äî who predicted Trump‚Äôs 2016 victory ‚Äî  claims most Americans dislike responding to polls consisting of 25 or  more¬†questions.¬† Accordingly, Trafalgar‚Äôs polls feature under 10  questions.""  
This may be true, but there's no evidence that Republicans are disproportionately represented amongst people who only respond to polls that are sufficiently short.  

3. ""Also, conservatives, generally ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like to participate in  polls,""¬†Cahaly says.¬† ‚ÄúWe see a five-to-one refusal rate among  conservatives,‚Äù he¬†told National Review magazine.""   
The AAPOR study linked above found no evidence of a higher non-response rate amongst Trump voters than Clinton voters. There is no evidence that this has significantly changed.  

4. ""Then there‚Äôs the size of most survey samples, which aren‚Äôt large enough, in my experience, to determine accurate responses.""  
Good pollsters report the confidence intervals of their sample data. Whether they are ""accurate"" depends upon what size interval you are satisfied with.  

5. ""Leaving even more space for error, many pollsters today are contacting only *registered* voters, as opposed to voters who consistently vote ‚Äî¬†likely voters.""  
Perhaps some pollsters are still contacting only registered voters, but most good pollsters are surveying likely voters.  

6. ""Then there‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs spectacularly strong support from some first-time  voters aged 50 and older, and 25 and under.¬† They are, demographically  speaking, ""under the radar,"" and will help to sink Biden-Harris.""  
Again, this is pure speculation, and there is no evidence that, amongst the demographics where Trump is polling well, his advantage large enough to outweigh his disadvantage in other demographics.  


Essentially the ""fake polls"" narrative exists for practical reasons, not because there's any strong evidence to disbelieve the polls. 1) To maintain voter enthusiasm among likely Republican voters; 2) to lay the groundwork for any attempt to challenge the election results in the courts."

Hopefully you can spare a minute to do so. TLDW: Yes, while religion may at one point helped further advances in sciences and arts, it's certainly not doing so now. Just as training wheels are good for a 4 year old, they're disadvantagous to anyone who already knows how to ride a bike.

Yes MOE exists but the odds that the near maximum amount margin of error in Trump to push him forward while the near maximum amount of MOE for Biden to push him back over the course of all these polls done....is rare.  Possible, but rare.

Right now Biden has more then 3X chance to win the state of Texas then Trump does just to win the election...so again not impossible but rare things work many ways"

States run by Republicans will show strange vote counts with many canceled votes and Trump winning by a small or even tiny margin. Top suspects to watch for this will be Florida, georgia, and Texas. Trump will immediately declare himself the winner and blame Democrats for obstructing the vote. The burden to prove any wrongdoing will fall on the Biden campaign. The DoJ will fight the Biden campaign. Republicans will try to draw this out into an endless legal battle, steering everything towards a supreme court stacked with Republican operatives. Meanwhile Trump will remain president.

The GOP has already set this in motion. Biden needs to get enough votes to make this too difficult for Republicans to pull off."

2020-11-01 05:18:33,garlmqu,t3_jlwdpd,TapedeckNinja,t1_garizgf,"538's projection model has been updated since 2016. Pollsters have updated their weighting methodology. There is little ""undecided"" padding this year. There is little third-party polling support this year. This is not a 1:1 comparison.

And if Selzer is a sign that ""all might not be well in the Midwest"", then what are we to make of PPP dropping a Biden +11 poll today in Minnesota (and +10 in Michigan) and ABC dropping a Biden +17 in Wisconsin a couple of days ago?"

2020-11-01 05:13:29,garlb6a,t3_jlwdpd,urnbabyurn,t1_garklfe,"No, what I‚Äôm saying is that the margin of error isn‚Äôt applied to the difference. It‚Äôs applied to each persons percentages when there is a third category (notice they don‚Äôt add up to 100%?). IIRC, it was 41-48, right? So the MoE for trump versus not trump is 4, so trump is anywhere between 37 and 46.  Applying that to Biden, he is anywhere between 44-52.  So within that 95% CI is a chance of trump up by 1 or 2 points over Biden. That is simply considering sampling error, not the systemic polling errors. 

Now, that is not to say it‚Äôs as likely within that 95% as Biden being ahead, but MoE doesn‚Äôt apply to the margin.  

We really need to do a difference in proportions MoE for that."

2020-11-01 05:02:36,garklfe,t3_jlwdpd,sparky2212,t1_garimxj,"Yes, in the event of a second, presidential election in a row, large polling error, which the odds of happening are, very low. Not impossible, but not likely either."
2020-11-01 04:57:01,gark7x2,t3_jlwdpd,twwilde,t1_garizgf,"No, this is definitely not the ""same everything"" as 2016 and you'd have to have failed arithmetic to believe that. The polls in 2016 were off, but they were pretty much off within the margin that they advertised. You could find a third grader if you need someone to explain that you've got Biden outperforming Hillary by 7, 17, 9, and 10 points in the states you've listed. These aren't a ""handful of percentage points"", that's a very meaningful improvement.

If Trump is hoping for a repeat of his 2016 upset, he will need massive polling errors, not 2016 levels. Considering that many pollsters learned from 2016 and placed greater emphasis on education in weighting responses, they should be *more* accurate, not less."

Honestly He is probally the most unliked president of all time. and he has done nothing to grow his base. NOTHING. in fact he has made it even easier for people who might not have liked biden, to go out and vote for biden."

If those extra handful of percentage points are letting you sleep well at night, you are the only one.  The Iowa poll from today was as clear of a sign as you will get that all might not be well in the Midwest for Biden.  Same margin, same everything as Hillary in 2016."

So Biden could be 4 points lower and Trump up 4 points. So that leaves a part of that margin, albeit small, that both are occurring and Trump is up by 1.  So yeah, trump could be winning within that 95% CI.

That also doesn‚Äôt account for the standard 2  percentage point systemic polling error outside of regular sampling error. So no single poll is all that useful. All we really can say is looking at polling averages, there is a +/-2% average error (standard deviation) election over election in those averages."

2020-11-01 04:29:24,gari9rc,t3_jlwdpd,TheBirminghamBear,t1_garhur9,"Far, far better. 

For comparison, right now Trump is headed to Georgia in a last-ditch effort to improve polling numbers there.  Georgia *should* be a reliably red state and it's basically a toss-up right now. 

The fact that Trump is spending the final days fighting for Georgia, which should be very reliably red, rather than touring battleground states like Florida, Ohio or Michigan, is really bad for him."

Florida is close. Aggregate say Biden has a lead but Florida always tends to Florida so I'd say it's about a toss-up. 

Things are about as good as could reasonably be hoped for."
2020-11-01 04:23:39,garhur9,t3_jlwdpd,Christiano1996,t1_garh8j8,How does this compare to Hillary‚Äôs results 4 years ago?

2020-11-01 04:15:24,garh8j8,t3_jlwdpd,formeraide,t3_jlwdpd,"TEXT (graphs missing):

""As the presidential race enters its final days, competition remains fierce in two of the most important battleground states, with former vice president Joe Biden holding a slight lead over President Trump in Pennsylvania and the two candidates in a virtual dead heat in Florida, according to two Washington Post-ABC News polls.

Among likely voters in Pennsylvania, Biden is at 51 percent to Trump‚Äôs 44 percent, and Libertarian Jo Jorgensen is at 3 percent. Biden was leading by 54 percent to 45 percent a month ago. While the shift is slight, Biden no longer holds a statistically significant advantage, given the four-point margin of sampling error that applies to each candidates‚Äô support. Among all registered voters in the Keystone State, Biden is at 49 percent to Trump‚Äôs 45 percent, with Jorgensen at 3 percent.

In Florida, Trump is at 50 percent to Biden‚Äôs 48 percent among likely voters. Jorgensen registers at 1 percent. Last month, Trump was at 51 percent and Biden at 47 percent. Among registered voters in Florida, Trump stands at 49 percent with Biden at 47 percent. Last month among registered voters, Biden was at 48 percent and Trump at 47 percent. Those month-to-month shifts are not statistically significant.


Although there are other battleground states in play in these final days, many analysts see Florida and Pennsylvania as holding the keys to the outcome of the election. Trump won both states in 2016, but barely, taking Florida by just over one percentage point and Pennsylvania by less than one point.

Florida is considered as close to a must-win for the president as there is, because without its 29 electoral votes, his path to the necessary 270 electoral votes becomes significantly more challenging.

Pennsylvania is seen by Democrats as vital to Biden‚Äôs hopes of preventing the president from replicating his path four years ago through the heartland. Democrats think a Biden victory in Pennsylvania would signal success in Michigan and possibly Wisconsin as well and mark the restoration of the parts of the party‚Äôs blue wall that crumbled in 2016.

A group of Biden and Trump supporters gather outside the train station where Biden was campaigning in Greensburg, Penn. on Sept. 3. (Jeff Swensen/Jeff Swensen for The Washington Post)

Beyond the question of voting intentions, the two polls highlight the competitiveness of the two states and show some improvement for the president over the past month as the campaign has intensified ahead of Election Day on Tuesday.

Disapproval of the president has eased ever so slightly in both states since last month. In Florida, he is now in narrowly positive territory, with 51 percent of registered voters saying they approve and 47 percent saying they disapprove. Last month, 47 percent approved and 51 percent disapproved.


In Pennsylvania, his ratings remain negative, at 45 percent approving and 52 percent disapproving, a negative seven-point margin. Last month, Pennsylvania voters disapproved of Trump by a 12-point margin, so there has been a slight but potentially significant shift in his favor.

Trump‚Äôs approval rating on the economy is positive in both states. In Florida, 58 percent say they approve of the job he is doing with the economy, and 40 percent disapprove. Strong approval is 19 points higher than strong disapproval. In Pennsylvania, 54 percent approve, and 44 percent disapprove.

But voters in both states give him negative ratings on handling the coronavirus outbreak. In Florida, 51 percent disapprove to 47 percent who approve. In Pennsylvania, 54 percent disapprove, and 43 percent approve, with 52 percent saying they ‚Äústrongly‚Äù disapprove of the way Trump is handling the pandemic.

Majorities of voters in both states say they are ‚Äúvery‚Äù or ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù worried about they or someone in their immediate family catching the virus. In both states, those who are more worried strongly back Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), while those who are less worried slightly more strongly back the president and Vice President Pence.

Trump is trusted more than Biden to handle the economy by voters in Florida by 14 points ‚Äî 55 percent saying Trump to 41 percent saying Biden. In Pennsylvania, the margin is six points ‚Äî 49 percent to 43 percent in Trump‚Äôs favor."""

The federal government does not have the authority to issue a country wide mask mandate.  It could require them for all international, and interstate travelers l.  Im not really sure how they could enforce an interstate mask mandate though.

Believe it or not, there will come a day when COVID is just a documentary some lnsomniac watches on the history Channel at 3am.  And when we get there I'd rather still be living in a country of laws.  Anytime you want to give the federal government more power, ask yourself do i want a competent Trump to have it."

Would you stop with this fucking hyperbole? Seriously you've responded to two people addressing how its possible biden could be avoiding saying he would issue a mask mandate before the election to make sure he didn't lose votes, and you've responded twice with DoNt YoU cArE iF pEoPlE dIe!!1!

Remind me..isnt it the Republicans, the ones lacking integrity anyway, that have become McCarthyites? Always screaming about communism/socialism and labeling every Democrat that they see as a threat.

Anyone that can oust Trump is not ""the wrong choice"".

I'm not concerned about the House at all. In fact, I expect the Dems may well win the Senate on top of the presidency.

They'll finally be able to restore some of the Democratic principles that Trump so readily tore to shreds-along with his posse of corporate owned, women/POC hating criminals."

Please answer truthfully because I want to try to understand the heads around people who rather have Trump than Biden. If Biden, let‚Äôs say, couldn‚Äôt drink a glass of water with one hand, would you call him weak? What if he needed assistance walking down a ramp? I look forward to your response."

""Georgia Democrats are like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football. Every year, they make a run at turning the light-red state blue ‚Äî and Lucy, in the form of the Georgia GOP, snatches away victory at the last moment.

But in 2020, Charlie Brown‚Äôs kicking foot just might find its target.

According to the FiveThirtyEight polling average, Joe Biden leads President Trump by 1.6 points in the Peach State, while RealClearPolitics gives Biden a .8-point lead. Major handicappers rate both of the state‚Äôs Senate races as toss-ups. Both Trump and Biden are making late stops in Georgia, and both parties are blanketing the state with TV ads, a sign they agree the race there is tight.

On the presidential level, Trump is a victim of the very realignment that won him the White House in the first place.

In the pre-Trump era, Republicans easily won Georgia by catering to White voters. In nearly every election, GOP candidates would win by landslide margins with non-college-educated White voters ‚Äî many of whom are evangelical Christians ‚Äî and take most of the college-educated White vote, while losing the overwhelming majority of Black voters. It was an ugly political equilibrium that played on the state‚Äôs historical racial divisions, but the net result was that Republicans routinely won statewide elections by safe, stable single-digit margins.

But the firewall began to crumble as Trump alienated suburbanites ‚Äî both through his incompetence and racist remarks. The shift was already visible in 2016, in fact, when Trump won college-educated White voters by only 23 points, a 15-point decline from Mitt Romney‚Äôs showing four years earlier. Metro Atlanta ‚Äî a region of 6 million that is 46 percent White, 34 percent Black and 11 percent Hispanic ‚Äî trended away from the GOP. By 2018, Democrats had flipped the suburban 6th Congressional District ‚Äî Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich‚Äôs former home ‚Äî while gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams fell just 1.4 points of short of victory. Now the Monmouth University poll shows Trump leading with college-educated White Georgians by a mere seven points.


No, White, college-educated suburbanites aren‚Äôt the GOP‚Äôs only problem this year. Biden seems to have gained a small foothold with blue-collar White voters; Trump has only slightly boosted his standing with Black voters; and Biden‚Äôs overall popularity with swing voters is probably helping him. But above all, Trump is seeing the downside of the trade he made in 2016: He won Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan by swapping blue-collar Whites for suburbanites, but it has cost him ‚Äî and the rest of the GOP ‚Äî strength in urbanized Sun Belt states such as Georgia.

The Trumpian realignment is hurting GOP congressional candidates, too. But it‚Äôs not the only reason Republicans are in trouble down the ballot, where both the state‚Äôs Senate seats are being contested.

Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Rep. Douglas A. Collins, running in a special election for the Senate seat Loeffler filled by appointment this year, have been victims of their own attempts to game the state‚Äôs open primary system. In many Georgia elections, all candidates run on the same ballot on Nov. 3, and if none gets more than 50 percent, the top two advance to a January runoff. Collins and Loeffler clearly think that the best way to secure their spot ‚Äî and beat the other ‚Äî is to outflank each other on the right. That could prove decisive in a runoff against a Democrat that may hinge on Trump-weary suburbanites and Biden-voting swing voters.


The same dynamic has endangered Republican Sen. David Perdue, who recently decided to skip his debate with Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff after one of Ossoff‚Äôs volleys against him went viral on social media. Rather than face his opponent again, Perdue is opting to join Trump at a rally in northwest Georgia ‚Äî tying him more closely to a president who may not win the state.

Republicans still have a roughly 50-50 shot of winning these races, but the fact they are close is telling: In Georgia at least, the trades Trump that made in 2016 are coming back to haunt him ‚Äî and his party ‚Äî in 2020."""

2020-11-01 17:37:41,gat6l5p,t3_jluf23,Magick3399,t3_jluf23,What makes this the dumbest Trump neve ever is that his signaling the High Court to intervene almost requires the Conservative Justices to avoid any appearance of personal bias or force the Democrats to remodel the Court as a priority if there is a change in the WH or Senate.
2020-11-01 16:04:27,gasw6r5,t3_jluf23,MrBalanced,t1_garxheu,"In addition to what other people have said about working to support people who *can* protest, the thing about general strikes is that, once enough people are involved, it becomes much harder to avoid participating in one way or another.

If shipping and logistics get shut down? Eventually stores and restaurants will have little or nothing to sell, tradesmen have no materials to work with. This will lead to fewer jobs to do, and you may no longer have a choice about whether you go to work. This is where stockpiling necessities and teaming up with your neighbors becomes to important.

If your job continues to stay open during a general strike, in support of the coup and in spite of (likely) dramatically reduced revenues, then you continuing to show up to look busy and collect your paycheck can help punish that. Hopefully it will be an option for you.

Are you a business owner yourself? Here, you have a hard choice. Stay open, and you are unequivocally supporting the coup. You may be boycotted long after this dark episode ends. Close down, or offer dramatically shorter hours, while making it crystal clear *why* this is happening, and you might save enough in your wages line item to limp back to life when all this is over. Again, it boils down to what relationships you have made with your clients, your neighbors, up to this point.

I'm not trying to shame you when I say this, but: If a coup happens and you continue to go about as though everything is okay, you are supporting the illegitimate regime and harming the people who are attempting to make things better. Even if you don't believe that striking will matter, or if you prioritize the short-term comfort of your and your immediate family over all else, please remember:

Supplies may be in difficult to come by. Stock up on necessities.

You and your neighbors will likely need to support each other. Have these conversations now.

As parts of the system slow down or stop, your job may not be guaranteed. Prepare for protesting to become your full time job."

2020-11-01 05:45:16,garnbjs,t3_jltrfe,kainharo,t1_gar1n3r,Yes. It's still a process to get citizenship but marrying a Canadian is the most direct way. The Canadian has to be able to support the American financially and there's a long administrative process to go through which will result in Permanent Residency and after 3 years of residency the individual can then apply for full citizenship. Check Immigration Canada website for more info.

Ontario elected a Conservative government, headed by a psycho taking lessons from Republicans, a couple years ago. But you should remember that a Canadian conservative is a centrist Dem in the USA.

The task of  proving any wrongdoing will fall on the Biden campaign who will need to litigate the fraud. The DoJ will fight the Biden campaign. Republicans will try to draw this out into an endless legal battle, steering everything towards a supreme court stacked with Republican operatives. Meanwhile Trump will remain president.

There are lots of possibilities, many of which won't happen. Until a thing actually happens, it's merely speculation. In general, a good way to keep sane in a sometimes crazy world is to, hope for the best, and plan for the worst.

It's okay to feel multiple things at the same time. It's okay to both hope for a Biden victory, and be concerned about Trump's possible actions in court. The possibilities aren't binary, and your thinking on it doesn't have to be either.

Lastly, you aren't a contestant on a game show. Nobody is testing you on calling it right. Entertain that there are a range of possible outcomes that remain at present uncertain... It's okay to be unsure. We all are."

So his 'economy' is really just continuing the work Obama did (and due to him and his party being complete fuck ups, the Covid crisis wiped out those job gains - the 11 million jobs in the article don't even get us to the employment levels when he took office off the top of my head.

 He's squandered any gains to the economy from the business stimulus of the tax cuts with his asinine tariffs (we pay for them, not the Chinese) and the billions he threw at farmers to bail them out from his fuck-up with the ongoing trade war (thought those were easy to win..?). The few new parts of the wall he's added have several sections that \*already\* need to be replaced/repaired, he's yet to release his tax returns as promised, still not even a bullet point summary of his beautiful health care plan to replace Obamacare, still hasn't had Mexico pay for the wall, Hillary is still not in jail and coal is in worse shape than ever.

 So where are these promises he kept?"

That's some mighty fine cherry picking. You should do it professionally.

&gt; Unless you don't accept Wikipedia as a source. I am sure your own source says the same.

Okay sure, lets use Wikipedia:

Actual quote: ""Fascism (/Ààf√¶ É…™z…ôm/) is a form of **far-right**, **authoritarian ultranationalism**[1][2] characterized by **dictatorial power**, *forcible suppression of opposition* and **strong regimentation of society and of the economy**[3] which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.""

The first characterization of fascism is that its far right, from the source you attempt to cherry pick from. The second is authoritarian ultranationalism, and Lord knows if anyone is big on authoritarian ultranationalism its ""the left"". Not going to bother going any further."

The only reason they weren't able to engage in an extreme coverup is that being digital, everything they did was right there to be seen-- but that didn't stop them from lying their asses off about it and working (successfully with many) to convince the public that they totally did nothing wrong.

Not that the conservative party is perfect they have more extreme members and focus highly on economy, but especially Angela Merkel is a very knowledgeable and has a lot of common sense. I think that the difference between her and a lot of other conservatives in Germany and generally world wide, is that she focuses on what i call common sense conservatism which a lot of other conservatives tend to ignore for their ideals. I think that this is why she was so well liked among the population in general. Common sense and the sense for sustainability is a thing lacking more and more within politics, be it on both ends of the traditional political spectrum or outliers usually within neo-liberal or green parties who focus on a few select issues for their whole program and ignore the most important parts of sustainability and achievability which causes further rifts and divides and therefore lowers achievability for any goal and further demonises opposition to own party goals."

Your comment is fantastic, but on this point you couldn't be more incorrect.

Republican ideology is a bunk corporate handjob. Their ideology is that government's job is to enrich the powerful. Their entire ideology revolves around robbing the public purse to enrich the rich, lying to their constituents about the economy and the effects of their policies, and generally treating elected office as an opportunity to do evil, dishonest, pro-ruling class things.

Their political machinations are not aimed at achieving honest, constructive governance. 

In my country, the main center-right party is also far more corrupt, dishonest, and criminal than the main center-left party. I'd wager that's pretty common across the globe.

This group of people and way of thinking appears to be typical of the die hard Trump supporters.

The electoral college clearly favors minority rule, case in point 2 of our last Republican Presidents lost the popular vote, but won the electoral college. The states they won by account for a smaller population than states that went for the other candidates.

Same with Congress. Currently, the GOP Senators that pushed Amy Coney Barrett through represent 14 million fewer Americans than the Democratic Senators that opposed her confirmation.

In regards to the House, there‚Äôs a limit to the number of representatives allowed in the House of Congress. While Representatives should climb with increased populations of states based on the Census each year, instead this limit just shifts the number of representatives around different states. Making sure smaller states always have a certain number of reps. It‚Äôs false equivalency democracy, rather than equal representation.

Lastly, even the establishment of certain states was a move to help stack political power for minority rule. This goes back to the electoral college. The argument conservatives like to make is that if we do away with the electoral college then ‚Äúonly the coasts will decide elections‚Äù or the ‚Äúheartland‚Äù will be left out. It‚Äôs a lot of appealing to rural America where frankly fewer people live and demonizing people who live in cities, the majority of the US population.

So, when you're looking at the Russia investigation, it was specifically an investigation looking into Trump's campaign and administration staff and investigating them for crimes. 

Whitewater, by contrast, was a special cousnel investigation of a real estate development company, of which the Clintons were investors. 

Many of the convictions in that case have nothing to do with the Clinton administration.  And they were not found to have any criminal wrongdoing in the case. 

There's some reading that needs to go into the data.  And of course, the Republicans are going to scree that that's bias, but you can't compare the fact that people directly and materially involved in the Trump administration being indicted, in many cases for matters directly involving Trump's criminality, are the same as a years-old real estate development company of which Clintons were investors."

The Democrats, while not a criminal enterprise, are still more than happy to maintain the status quo of the political duopoly, as it is the source of their power. 

The myriad state DNC chapters, especially in areas where they seldom win offices, are often extremely hostile to efforts to revitalize the party, as they've become very comfortable being the minority opposition party and have been doing the same thing for fifty years or longer. 

But it's much easier to extract change from that side, then it is from the party that not only is *comfortable* in their duopoly, but is actively converting their political party charter into an organized crime ring.

If you remember your recent history, Clinton was brought up on articles of impeachment for three crimes, was impeached on one, and given a not-guilty verdict.  Trump was brought up on impeachment for two crimes, was impeached for both, and given not-guilty verdicts for them.  Impeachment is not a party issue.

Each and every single president from starting from when I was old enough to start to be aware of and understand politics has done something that at least some people feel is a crime, and others support.  Only two of them have had articles of impeachment brought up against them so far, and zero convictions have taken place.  If you look at the number of charges brought to vote for impeachment, it's 3-2 in favor of the Democratic presidents, so technically the Republican presidents have had the ""free ride"" from a purely mathematical standpoint."

This party has been calcifying more and more into a hardened crime ring. The moderates have run for the fucking hills because they can't compete and they've been squeezed out. 

Obligatory devil's advocate that the one legitimate point for 'both parties' is the specific context of 'both parties support the two-party-system'. Should be pretty on-the-nose as to why they might do that, despite there being fairly credible concern that a two-party-system creates a whole host of issues any other, more democratic, system does not have.

Of course, you're perfectly correct that usually 'both parties are the same' is thrown about as badly coordinated attempts at deflection.

The so-called ‚Äòflyover states‚Äô and most rural areas of the major states will be ungovernable if they feel like they‚Äôre going to be permanently sidelined‚Äì if the urbanites try to use a government they control to enforce against rural areas, the balloon will go up when the rural areas don‚Äôt yield. It isn‚Äôt state vs. state, it‚Äôs rural vs. urban, and in that scenario it‚Äôs the left-leaning cities that will be pockets of highly populated resistance to the geographical encirclement of the people who don‚Äôt live in and around cities. 

That‚Äôs why I said it would be like Syria, where you can‚Äôt exactly draw a front and borders between warring factions, it‚Äôs going to be rough areas of control with fighting predominantly being near major cities. Without international aid, it would take a matter of weeks for cities to surrender or they‚Äôd face being starved out by the people who produce the food. California is especially vulnerable because cities like Los Angeles don‚Äôt have enough water locally to hydrate its people, and the aqueducts can be blocked. The West Coast in general will be bad because most of the actual extremists on both sides are in that region. Meanwhile, the places that would look most like a war of borders would be the Midwest and South, albeit the South has geographically concentrated bands of left-leaning minorities that would be troublesome for the conservatives that dominate those states. The stronghold for the left would be the Northeast because the closely backed cities near the coast would offer some degree of contiguous territory that  can be linked with less effort than would be needed to link cities in the interior, and these cities are highly populated. Still though, the food problem will come along in not much time. 

Bottom line: if the left doesn‚Äôt organize forces and conquer rural areas quickly to obtain necessary food and resources, they collapse to the right in a matter of months. On the other hand, even that might not work because they can‚Äôt farm the food themselves. It would get messy. 

None of this even considers that most military personnel come from conservative states by a large majority, and most have sympathy with conservatism even if they don‚Äôt have sympathy with a Trump‚Äì they‚Äôre unlikely to fire on their families. You can expect mass desertions if bloodshed mounts, and in many cases outright defections of units to the right, especially those located in areas controlled by the right, which are most units because their bases are generally located in conservative states as liberal states don‚Äôt tend to want the military around. Very few units will end up actually fighting on the side of the left, even if the government is controlled by the left, because the military will probably weasel out of actually being deployed on American soil to avoid the potential of service branches tearing themselves apart when ordered into action against their own beliefs and families.

Oh, and I guess most police are also conservatives, even in cities, and if the gloves came off they‚Äôd be the only ones in major cities with actual weapons. Could make it so that conservative rural militias are able to just walk in and reinforce after initial hostilities. 

I guess the moral of the story is it‚Äôs probably best for the less-than-adequately-armed-majority not to try to order around a massively armed minority against its own wishes when they make up the majority of military and police forces as well."

You're referring to holding an entire group of people based on nothing other than their heritage accountable for societal issues at large.  Yes, that was Nazi Germany and how the atrocities that were committed under Hitler's rule were allowed to take place.

Our current scenario is holding ONE person accountable for the crimes he (allegedly) committed both prior to and while in office, along with the specific people that aided and enabled him to do so.  We're not talking about rounding up all Trump supporters and putting them in concentration camps, we're talking about filing legal criminal charges and giving fair trials to specific people.

Note that I said allegedly above.  That is important.  While I do personally believe the accusations to be true, I recognize that my suspicions are based on very limited information that I have access to and that I do not have enough information to say with 100% certainty that he is guilty of the crimes.  Literally \*nobody\* does at this point, and nobody will until he is given a trial and testimony and evidence is presented for both the prosecution and defense.

I was deeply disappointed that his earlier impeachment ground to a halt for two reasons.  First, the obvious, I have an admittedly biased opinion that I believe his crimes are causing active harm to our country and our world at large.  I wanted to have the opportunity to see him prosecuted and removed from office in order to limit the harm.  Secondly, and this is just as important, if he were actually taken to trial and was found not-guilty of the charges, that would give the whole country an opportunity to put the controversy behind us and move forward.

As you can see, the topic of placing Trump on trial for his past and ongoing alleged crimes has absolutely nothing to do with Hitler and Nazi Germany.  On the other hand, many hold the opinion that Trump and his followers are following very similar patterns to Hitler and his followers as Hitler was coming into power, but that is an entirely different discussion than we are having here."

Like my very presence is a threat. And while all trump supporters are not racist, I‚Äôve found that most racists are trump supporters. 

And my Jewish friend is voting for him because Biden is a ‚Äùpedo.‚Äù Are we basing our democracy on choosing someone with the least *allegations* of pedophilia and not considering a wide range of other facts? Really? Yes pedophilia is bad but there are unproven allegations on both sides. 

Hitler was right about a lot of things but wrong about one big thing. Please do not vote in someone who is hateful and threatening to the very existence of non-white people. I pay my taxes and mind my business and am a Christian like a lot of Trump supporters. I just look different and now I don‚Äôt feel safe going certain places, which is depressing and unfair. 

Please think before you vote. There is no place for hate here. Hate is a slippery slope. First it will be Mexicans and Muslims. Then blacks and communists. Then socialists and liberals. Then Jews. Then...

Where will it stop? Remember this poem when you vote:

First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out‚Äî
     Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out‚Äî
     Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out‚Äî
     Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me‚Äîand there was no one left to speak for me.

2020-11-01 15:22:48,gasrqax,t3_jls9qe,roche10,t1_garz0un,"Germany wasn't a functioning country at all. It was a smoking crater from both the Allies attacking and from delusional Hitler clinging on to the doorframe of the bunker lying to himself that 'Hitler land' was coming.

The allies made the Germans look at the reality of supporting a mad man. They dragged them into the camps and made them smell and see the death, they also made them clean up the mess they created. everyday men and women had to clear the rubble and it was those consequences that showed actions have them.

Of course some fled, some rebelled. That is par for the course with anything really. We're not all going to move in unison. It takes time. But this along with the Nazi trials did denazify the country. And the proof is today and what the Nazis are seen as in the annals of pop culture (society's reflection) and Germany owned their history. It made sure that the country knew Hitler and his ilk was an evil pos. They don't deny their mistakes.

This is the problem right here. America does deny and pass the buck on it's mistakes. The country won't develop and grow untill it acknowledges the problem. Trump is a scumbag no doubt but he's just exposed and encouraged what always existed. What we see now is the infected underbelly of America. America doesn't even teach children the proper history of the country. It decimated the native indians,  there was a civil war simply because one side threw a tantrum that it couldn't have human beings as slaves anymore, then segregation happened showing these human beings were free in spirit only, the police came out of slave catchers etc. The country is built on racism, superiority (freakin slaves built the WHITEhouse) and systemic abuse.

We don't tell the country that this is not ok. We move the goalposts on horrific actions, pass blame and live in total denial. Look, when people are protesting to 'preserve' racist history? That's a serious problem. You can look at it as Americas nazis were the confederacy. But you rose tinted the confederacy for so long. 2020 and these statues are only coming down now??

And a specific party is the cancer of the country. You can say whatever you want about democrats e.g. corruption, conspiracy theories etc. But one fact remains here and that is Democrats live in the modern age wanting to progress and move forward into the future. I have never before witnessed in my life a party like the Republican party that acts like it came from a tear in history. And the otherside was the freakin confederacy. I have never witnessed a more regressive party ever, that actually wants and tries to policy the country backwards so far in time. And that is Americas cancer. And now this cancer party is adopting freakin nutjob conspiracy theories. So in my eyes i see a sociopathic party that is only interested in power and ego. Nothing more. If the country burns and it hurts the American people - no biggie, because look at all the power. And Americans keep allowing them power.

And look this is not about parties being better than one another. This is an objective viewpoint right now. But what the Republican party has done is so blatant that you can't deny this. You just can't at all. I don't care if you wanna just stick it to the liberals. But there is no movement with this party. It's going in reverse in fact. I look at the Republican party and it's akin to the draconian medieval religious iron fist rule of something like the Taliban. You know? The group that still thinks it lives in the past and likes it there. That is a cancer. Like i said, for me decency/morals/capacity for change. These are very important, and if they fall by the wayside well then you may as well be another species. And overall i see the democrats as flawed humans, but humans all the same. And i see the Republican party as? well a reflection of the sociopath with malignant narcissism that has now highjacked them. Twittler is allowed to get away with his crimes because they allow him to. Because they encourage and enable him to do it.

This is the problem America. This party that lives on pathological lies, gaslighting, and blatant criminal activity...and now their new platform? insane conspiracy theories. This party is going Nazi as we speak and that is not an exaggeration at all. Qanon is in your freakin party and that's a tiny step to the freakin 'atlantian' race and religious relics being invented to support an 'immortal' lineage. Our history is there so we can learn from it and deem not to repeat it. Calling the clown college stupid nazis is not hysteria. I think some people need to go back and learn about how the nazis got into power. It was slow and methodical. And they were considered a joke at one point. And then the holocaust happened.

 I wish people would actually take this serious, because how could you see the horrors of the nazis and tell yourself it will never get that bad again? And as you're speaking history is repeating?  If only people would educate themselves they'd see this goes beyond which party is better than the other. This is about human beings and what they are capable of regardless of party. It takes one thing to make human attrocities happen. That is lack of empathy (sociopath) and then the rest takes care of itself. We have that sitting in office at the moment and as for the rest??"

Way oversimplified, Calvinism believes that there are people who are ""elected"" by God before the universe was even formed.  You may have heard this as ""predestination. "" So, God has already separated those who are damned from those who are saved at the beginning of time, and there is nothing that the damned can do about it.

Coincidentally, most conservatives see themselves as the elect, and many of these are the rich and powerful. Why would God have given these people riches and power if they were not already a part of the elect?

The problem is that this allows conservatives to turn their backs on the poor BIPOC folks, and pretty much anyone else who do not conform to their view of the ""elect."" It doesn't matter what they do fir the lower classes, they were already damned before time began.

Don't heal, instead stay angry for 20+ years and vote. That's the ONLY way you can fix the damage done. Healing is just a feeling of calm that may or may not be real.

Did we heal as a nation when we elected the first black President? It's not about feelings and philosophy, it's about consistently voting every 2 years.

Democrats are in this mess because after 2008 they mass embraced ass sitting and low turnout. You can't 'heal' a nation just voting big every now and then, it takes consistency and constant pressure. 

Radicalism and racism aren't going away anytime soon. If Biden wins he'll be in a competition with Obama to receive the most death threats of any president ever. That's what almost half the country has become or is ok with.

You can't heal that away, you have to address, mitigate and fix it. We've been healing since the civil war or since civil rights....

Obama was a fucking war criminal. More airstrikes than Bush and he had a 90% civilian kill percentage with those. He sucked up to the Saudis, helped bring slavery back to Africa with Libya and exacerbated the migrant crisis in Europe. Expanded the drone wars and took us from two wars to even more middle east interventionism even after campaigning on ending that. There are multiple articles written about Obama going after whistleblowers, even former whistleblowers the Bush administration dropped charges on (John Kiriakou) and the press. I simply don't understand how people put rose colored glasses on when looking at all the fucked up shit that went on during his administration like it was such a golden era for America im every way. It simply wasn't. Tons of the precedents he set Trump is following now which doesn't make them any less fucked up.

Now, I do believe that... Somewhere deep, deep down... Maybe I just hope that many old school Republicans that have been in government for a while (like Barr) still believe in America's democracy as a whole; they just don't want it.

The other thing that worries me when I imagine this path is that they played with fire and they got burned... Trump's populism is absolutely using known fascist patterns.  From l√ºggenpresse (fake news) to brownshirts/blackshirts ([army for Trump](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/31/biden-trump-texas-bus/))... From voter suppression to calling everyone socialist (Democrats are not socialist... And even socialist is NOT far right - that's communism).

Basically the Democrats started becoming more ""liberal"" and moving more toward civil rights beginning in the mid-40s. People voted for that if they supported it, which put pressure on candidates who wouldn't support that platform and drew in others who would. This resulted in many racist Republicans and Democrats being voted out of power, forcing candidates to realign with the party that was more ideologically relevant to their views. It was a very smooth transition, since there were still historical associations that had to be overcome within the electorate. The Republican party was still known as the ""party of Lincoln"" and continued to receive support even as the party shifted to be less reflective of that history. Slowly, but surely, realignment occurred and things greatly accelerated after the signing of the 1964 CRA and the 1965 VRA. Both parties had members who switched to the other party (Hillary Clinton was a Republican before 1968, for example). Constituencies forced candidates to shift parties, especially black voters (newly more empowered) who overwhelmingly fled the Republican party after CRA/VRA/Goldwater, by voting out candidates they didn't support. Nixon intentionally courted white racists to consolidate his electorate (the famous Southern Strategy), mostly solidifying the realignment to what we see now by the end of the 1970s. It continues in that vein, largely spurred by the courting of white evangelical Christians and the coalitions Reagan built that echo strongly today."

Yeah, alot of people said that in 1989 (30 years ago) when initial information was released.

You are aware that nearly every ritch person has a charity set up because they can use it to reduce taxes right? It was found that a total 10k of the foundations (at the time 2 million dollar bank account) were misused for campaign purposes so it was shut down after giving millions to charity. 


&gt;tax evasion and fraud

And yet another baseless accusation


&gt;running a scam university that was also dissolved

The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative was a series of seminars people could attend for a cost and people thought they could dogpile on the Trump hate train to get there money back and they succeeded. 


&gt;criminal mismanagement of the covid pandemic, 

Another lie. He closed the country early. And with the US being such a large and diverse country it was state governors responsibility to say what restrictions to put in place.

After the city's were already abandoned by law enforcement and overrun with rioters, violence and murders.

That's not new for presidents. But trump hasn't given anyone in his family over qualified positions. His daughter and her husband are just two of his advisors and both have no pay. 


&gt;attacking democracy and even suggesting his voters commit voter fraud

Not true again. He told people to go to the polls to make shure there ballot was received. The stated goal was to ensure people's ballots get counted, not to elicit double voting.


&gt;and of course just being a petty vindictive self absorbed ass unfit for being a retail manager much less the president.

How about there support for violent rioters and cop killers who spout socialists propaganda under the veil of racial equally. 
The Biden family FBI investigation for money given to them by foreign countries. 
Joe Bidens lack of support for integrated schools sighting his want to avoid a ""racial jungle"". 
The constant slander and lies put out by the lefts media. 
The way Joe Biden refuses to answer the question ""will you pack the court"" responding by saying the voters don't deserve to know.

It's just that in the domain of governance, most problems involve groups of people rather than individuals so the conservative approach fails. I attributed this to conservative thought failing to distinguish between individuals and groups while liberal thought is better at making the distinction, but maybe that's not quite true. Stereotyping is hardwired into our lizard brains so it is reasonable for both conservatives and liberals to fail at it frequently. However, when a conservative mistakes a group for an individual it has political ramifications (i.e. the politics of personal responsibility). When a liberal treats an individual like a group they come across as an asshole, but it may not filter into politics as much (I'm thinking SJWs who act according to the conservative stereotype of social justice).

Then again, maybe it's not true. For example, the ""black-on-black crime"" as a justification for racial profiling, disdain for prisoner rights, and hatred for immigrants (illegal immigrants, refugees, people seeking asylum and I'm pretty sure legal immigrants to some extent given Trump's actions there) and anti-Islam fervor are all examples of conservatives treating individuals as groups.

 the ""states rights people""  who want to ban abortion and just love it when Donald Trump signs executive orders

 my personal favourite is this:   ""Joe Biden is racist for enacting racist police policies""

Is that in our best interest as a nation? Also keep in mind foreign powers would know that our Presidents will have an aversion to War because said President doesn't want to be held liable to a future war crime...

Maybe cut out the overthrowing of democratically elected governments because they weren't the US's preferred choice might be a place to start.

 This has serious effects.

 When is the last time anyone said ""good job CBS news?"" never.  Because why the fuck would you.

 But all day long, for years, Republican crazies email CBS news and say  ""you are destroying america""  and yeah they don't even watch CBS news.  They are just lying.  Because they are crazy but also know the value of working the refs.

 

This happens all day long, at every ""liberal media"" outlet.   They are literally demanding that people ignore reality.

so my theory, totally just guesses, is that Trump knows Barr isn't going to arrest Biden and Barr is only not arresting Biden because they have nothing on him and not enough support to just arrest him 

 Trump knows this and that is why he's not going to start a civil war in a few days, because he can't rely on Barr to just arrest all his enemies, because Barr thinks they'd lose, not because Barr isn't a monster or doesn't care enough about Jesus, just a simple calculation about risk 

 

it'll be neat to read/ see a book/netflix documentary, where pedophile Barr, turns out to be the only thing that didn't get millions of Americans killed

This article was talking about ""holding him accountable"" in the context of *prosecution*. Is ""peddling his bullshit"" automatically a *criminal* offense worthy of holding Republican Senators ""accountable"" in the same way as Trump? Or would peddling Trump's bullshit merely be *political* misconduct that warrants political (rather than criminal) consequences? 

Separating those two things is very important. A lot of people here are talking about how prosecution is necessary because failing to do so would have consequences that are damaging to the nation. Fine. Going along with that, I hope people would consider the *consequences* of trying to *criminally* hold people accountable just for supporting and enabling Trump. That's far more likely to look like a politically-oriented retribution if there aren't very clear charges that will certainly stick, and the ramifications of Democrats doing a political purge could be absolutely devastating. The consequences of that could be a shitload of Republican Senate and House members being put on trial and then *acquitted*, followed by a subsequent backlash against the Democratic Party that could haunt them for lord knows how long. Then a strong backlash against Democrats, followed by Republicans doing politically oriented prosecutions against Democrats while constantly messaging that Democrats set the precedent for that. 

Look, I get it. He committed crimes and not prosecuting him normalizes that stuff and encourages others to do it. But if it goes that way, that needs to be done *very* carefully. Stuff like holding ""every politician and pundit who enabled him accountable"" (which in the the context of this article means *politically* accountable) is potentially some very serious and damaging shit."

I'm going to sound like a ""both sides"" here but I believe there is generational strife happening with in individual bands within the FN. They are not a unified group. Each band governs themselves and the GoC has to negotiate and have special deals with each band. 

The issue is that the chiefs are hereditary while some bands have hereditary and elected chiefs. Again, it's different within each band.

First of all, any presidential administration that comes in and starts actively looking to investigate and prosecute their predecessor is stepping into political hot water as well as setting a potentially dangerous precedent. Now obviously in this case that would be more than justified, but the justification for it needs to be weighed against those factors. That has nothing to do with ‚Äúhealing‚Äù anything, it‚Äôs just a political calculation.

So you didn‚Äôt have this question of how much the actual administration should be the one doing the investigating versus either leading state level investigations do the job, or waiting until a new attorney general can ‚Äúorganically‚Äú establish need to investigate the past rather than come in with that as their stated intention. It could be that Biden is Jones Ing to throw the book at Trump, but has to soft pedal it for the sake of optics.

And that‚Äôs not even getting into the question of whether the prosecutions would succeed. From where we are now we think it certainly must be easy to bring Trump down but remember that there is an entire network of corruption that would be exposed we‚Äôre here to be successfully investigated, and everyone involved and it will have a major incentive to try and roadblock in the investigation. This, incidentally, is a major reason why I think it is foolish to believe that if Trump loses and is investigated Republicans will somehow distance themselves from him rather than make him a cause Celebre (and excellent distraction).

So yes, of course the investigations need to happen. There is no good future without it. But this is not some simple question of having the will to do so anymore than voting him out in the face of voter suppression and corrupt courts is just about voter will."

I'm not saying he is or ever was one himself, but he's been around long enough to understand the fraternity that Congress is and the bucket of secrets that it not just guards with their lives to protect the country, and perhaps the world, but the secrets that protect the Congress itself.  

You'd be kidding yourself to believe that these aren't the most skeleton having people on the face of the earth.  These are the most powerful people on earth, who, apart from our military, have all the resources anyone would ever need to hide or even manipulate *any* truth.  These are the *real* people you would otherwise imagine holding Eyes-Wide-Shut-level secret rituals, sex cults and cigar room chats with wealthy *true* elites... and are sworn to secrecy, literally on their lives.  These are the people that *know* the secrets of our country, so it's entire possible and nearly inevitabl that that power will be used to veil the shadiest conduct imaginable, and their fraternity pacts prevent them from telling on each other unless they fuck up and an outside source nabs them for some random stupidity. They're *still* worn to secrecy for the real egregious acts.  It's like a mob capo gets nabbed by the feds they weren't paying off.  You still abide by the code or die.  

To be clear, I'm not conjuring some conspiracy theory and risking my own sanity dressing it up as some nut job fantasy... my point is that Biden knows about all this shit and we, as citizens have seen that there is ""bipartisan"" behavior outside of policy among congressmen, which may be good and necessary, but might be a massive barrier due to that ""fraternity"" congressional climate when it comes to prosecution of their own.  

I can only hope Biden can separate his history and politics and himself from that ""brotherhood"", for his passion for his country and its future... and recognize that many of his former and future colleagues have gone too far and devastated a nation, and it's no longer just the constituents that are casualties, but it's now the nation and its democracy on the line, and the existence of the entire planet.

The south launched the first attack on the north.

Why systemic racism doesn‚Äôt exist because they aren‚Äôt racist and Jim Crow is over. Why Democrats ‚Äúcall everyone racist‚Äù because they point out systemic racism in the justice system. Actually this is a common thread in their arguments against liberal policies (another good one is ‚Äúliberals all want handouts‚Äù or ‚Äúblack-on-black crime‚Äù as a justification for racial disparities in policing). It‚Äôs also the fundamental mindset needed for blatant racism (which is treating people of a certain group as if they are a stereotype of said group instead of an individual in their own right).

So yeah, if you are in that mind set, then being poor might make a person lazy because you‚Äôve heard of welfare queens who live off welfare. And since conservatives can‚Äôt distinguish between individuals and groups, this means all poor people are lazy sinners leeching off our taxes.

They fought for two years without that supply and of course Vietnam fell to communism. Huge tragic events occurred. Just to summarize. 

Also Nixon managed to open up China to the world which led to many things but most importantly, allowed US/UK economies to prosper having extreamly cheap labor and many other things that we took for granted, freed up jobs here so that we could do other things and innovate in other areas, but also helped China become a monolith and eventually to hold extream power"

Or at the very least, I would propose an entire suite of new legislation that restricted how politicians are allowed to organize and coordinate and advertise themselves.  I would also radically reform voting with advanced ranked-choice type voting systems that open up the serious chance for additional parties to win. 

I would also break up the DNC and RNC completely, and force them to refile as smaller organizations.  The exact same way we file anti-trust lawsuits against companies that are too large and are now a detriment to competition. 

If Democrats win on the 3rd I think there will be some good steps toward progress but I anticipate it to be a relatively underwhelming Presidency focused on ""returning to normal"" rather than radical reform.

[Here is a map](https://www.rockthevote.org/how-to-vote/) that shows how and when you can **vote in your state.** Please vote now.

**Some of the reasons why donald trump is not fit to lead this country:**

* He has repeatedly violated his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
* He has shown a breathtaking disregard for the lives and liberties of Americans.
* **His administration is rampantly corrupt.**
* **He celebrates violence.**
* **He divides and attacks Americans every single day.**
* **He has been grossly negligent with the public's health.**
* **He is incompetent in all international matters.**
* **He campaigned as a champion of ordinary workers, but he has governed on behalf of the wealthy.**
* **He's historically failed at doing any good in the matters of climate, immigration, women's rights and social justice reforms.**
* He's demonstrated consistently that he's [racist](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/19/opinion/trump-nazism-republican-party-failing.html) and [xenophobic](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/opinion/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court.html).
* He's damaged [NATO](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/opinion/editorials/why-nato-matters.html) and [lowered our standing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/nato-trump.html) in the world, a position many Americans have fought and died to secure.
* He's [abused his power and obstructed justice](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/14/opinion/sunday/trump-impeachment.html) \- any other president in American history would have been removed for the smallest offense on his list.
* When the House impeached donald trump, a complicit senate [refused to convict](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/opinion/trump-impeachment-vote.html) and remove him to protect themselves.
* Four more years of trump in office seriously threatens the chance that American democracy, an almost 250 year old idea that we've worked towards, survives.
* he has refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
* If he doesn't win, he'll work to confuse the election results and leave the decision up to a¬† supreme court unlawfully packed with conservative justices, some credibly accused of sexual assault and one potentially coming that his hostile towards the established rights of women and LGBTQ+ people.
* **He's a failed showman forever boasting about things he has never done, wealth he doesn't have and promising to do things he will never do.**
* He has sought to persuade both Congress and the courts to get rid of the Affordable Care Act without proposing any substitute policy to provide Americans with access to affordable health care.
* During the first three years of his administration, the number of Americans without health insurance [increased](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html) by 2.3 million.
* He promised an increase in the federal minimum wage and fresh investment in infrastructure; he delivered a round of tax cuts that mostly benefited rich people.
* He has indiscriminately erased regulations, and answered the prayers of corporations by suspending enforcement of rules he could not easily erase.
* **Under his leadership, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has stopped trying to protect consumers and the Environmental Protection Agency has stopped trying to protect the environment.**
* He walked away from the [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html). In its place, trump has conducted a trade war, imposing billions in tariffs ‚Äî taxes that are actually paid by Americans ‚Äî without any concessions from China.
* **Mr. Trump has treated the COVID-19 global pandemic as a public relations problem instead of working to save American lives.**
* He lied about the danger of the coronavirus, challenged the expertzs and resisted proactive precautions; now he's trying to force the economy open without bringing the virus under control.
* As the economy collapsed, he signed an initial round of aid and when the stock market rebounded, even though millions remained out of work, Mr. Trump lost interest.
* **In September, he declared that the virus ‚Äúaffects virtually nobody‚Äù the day before the death toll from the disease in the United States topped 200,000. Nine days later, he caught the virus and received $100,000 in taxpayer funded health care to fight the virus that he did nothing to avoid contracting.**
* He has pitted Americans against each other, weaponizing Twitter and Facebook to manipulate supporters around a virtual bonfire of grievances to flood the public square with lies, disinformation and propaganda.
* **At the first presidential debate in September, trump was asked to condemn white supremacists. He responded by instructing the Proud Boys to ‚Äústand back and stand by.‚Äù**
* In June, his administration tear-gassed peaceful protesters from a street in front of the White House so trump could pose with a book he does not read in front of a church he does not attend.
* trump has repeatedly directed administration officials not to testify before Congress or provide documents, notably including his tax returns.
* **With the help of AG william barr, he's shielded loyal aides (convicted criminals) from justice.**
* In May, the Justice Department said it would drop the prosecution of michael flynn even though flynn had [pleaded guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/michael-flynn-charges-dropped.html) to lying to the F.B.I.
* In July, trump commuted sentence of former aide, roger stone, who was convicted of obstructing a federal investigation of trump. Senator mitt romney condemned the act as an ‚Äúunprecedented, historic corruption.‚Äù
* trump pressured the Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, then directed administration to obstruct a congressional inquiry.
* In December, the House voted to impeach trump for high crimes and misdemeanors. Senate Republicans, excepting Mr. Romney, voted to acquit the president, ignoring his corruption so they could continue to fill the benches of the federal judiciary with [young, conservative lawyers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/trump-appeals-court-judges.html).
* The president votes by mail while saying it's corrupt without proof. His disinformation campaign serves as a rationale for purging voter rolls, closing polling places, tossing absentee ballots and otherwise impeding Americans from exercising their right to vote.
* **He cannot solve the nation‚Äôs pressing problems because he is the nation‚Äôs most pressing problem.** 

Frederick Douglass lamented during another of the nation‚Äôs dark hours, the presidency of Andrew Johnson, ‚ÄúWe ought to have our government so shaped that even when in the hands of a bad man, we shall be safe.‚Äù But that is not the nature of our democracy. The implicit optimism of American democracy is that the health of the Republic rests on the judgment of the electorate and the integrity of those voters choose.

The vast amount and variety of trump‚Äôs ""misdeeds"" can feel overwhelming. The repetition might have dulled your sense of outrage and it can leave us with little time to focus on the details. **That said, this moment is when Americans must recover their sense of outrage.** Use it to [VOTE and get others to VOTE.](https://www.rockthevote.org/how-to-vote/)

If we ever prosecute a US president for a war crime, that more or less ensures future Presidents will never commit an act of war to include measured responses.  Is that in our best interest as a nation?  Also keep in mind foreign powers would know that our Presidents will have an aversion to War because said President doesn't want to be held liable to a future war crime...  

It is Machiavelli politics.

Sorry, Trump is not going to get prosecuted.  Nor should he be prosecuted.

While the claim is inflated, between Trump, Reagan and Nixon, there were 157 administration officials indicted.  Between Obama, Clinton and Carter, there were a grand total of 2, both of them under Clinton.

The Democrat party is clearly not the sterling party of liberal values I'd prefer in a political party.  America doesn't actually even *have* the type of political party I'd prefer, or at least not once that has any inkling of a chance in any election.

2020-11-01 03:56:56,garftzx,t3_jls9qe,GrayEidolon,t1_gaqro5s,"It‚Äôs not republicans though. It‚Äôs conservatives. If the Republican Party is disassembled, conservatives will reassemble into a new party, disavow the Republican Party, and proceed with the same stuff. So what is conservatism and what do conservatives want?

Conservatism has the singular goal of maintaining an aristocracy that inherits political power and pushing everyone else down the ladder to create an under class. Secondary to that is a morality based on a person‚Äôs status as good or bad rather than their actions.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4CI2vk3ugk 


https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html


There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked or not clearly articulated. For liberals, actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and such status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.


In the world view of the actual conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from. The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights he is working against the aristocracy.


If we extend analysis to the voter base: Conservatives view other conservatives as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It‚Äôs why voter base conservatives think ‚Äúso what‚Äù whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things.


To them Donald Trump is a good person. The conservative isn‚Äôt lying or being a hypocrite or even being ""unfair"" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions. Lindsey Graham is ""good"" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.


To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor. Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was ‚Äúbad.‚Äù Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can‚Äôt do ‚Äúbad‚Äù things.


While a liberal would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can‚Äôt do bad.


A consequence of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality is that primary political goals are to do nothing when problems come up and to dismantle labor and consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral and inherently deserve punishment. They want the working class to get fucked by global warming. They want people to die from COVID19. Etc.


Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why do so many seem to dense? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them because being below them had made them immoral.


Absolutely everything conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above.


*****


We also need to address popular definitions of conservatism which are personal responsibility and incremental change: neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues, especially incremental issues.


This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well well do 1500 families next month.


But it‚Äôs all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It‚Äôs all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 


The incremental change argument is asinine. It‚Äôs propaganda to avoid concessions to labor.


The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the whole ""keep government out of my medicare thing."" Personal responsibility just means I deserve free things, but people more poor than me don't.""

&gt;Many westerners believed that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was largely motivated by its desire to take control over the latter's vast oil reserves. The Iraqi government justified its invasion by claiming that Kuwait was a natural part of Iraq carved off as a result of British imperialism. After signing the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, the United Kingdom planned to split Kuwait from the Ottoman territories into a separate sheikhdom, but this agreement was never ratified. The Iraqi government also argued that the Kuwaiti Emir was a highly unpopular figure among the Kuwaiti populace. By overthrowing the Emir, Iraq claimed that it granted Kuwaitis greater economic and political freedom.

There are many other historical and political factors at play that, to say the least, call into question the justification of the US invasion of Iraq."

Einstein's knowledge and discoveries matter because they're still (and to an extent always will be) true. But I wouldn't presume to apply his political hopes and dreams to the present day. A dead person should not have the ability to affect the future once they're gone. They don't have a vote, and I would suggest that that's okay, even despite this one instance.

Be wary of one-off anecdotes, and pay attention instead to statistics. Yes, it's unfortunate that this woman died before the election, but for every one person like her, there are dozens of rather more conservative people who die of old age between casting their vote and election day.

It's really not unreasonable that the arbitrary cutoff date be Election Day rather than, say, some point in the past by which point you were told you were dying. It makes sense for any ""miscounts"", for example, to be challengeable by a living person. Otherwise, the possibility exists that someone/thing works out a way to forge the votes of terminally ill people to the advantage of a particular side."

Don't presume. Answer it for the cases exactly like hers. Chance of dying very close after the election. barely held on. Which really counts? Closing of polls, counts done, or actual election decided?
You can still strike them at any time. How about an ordered recount? Still count them?

&gt;That's why we decided

That is the core question here. Did we? Or did we decide that when you cast your vote, that vote counts when you cast it?
I understand that technically speaking that used to be a question not asked before ""early voting"" because the US decided that actually giving people the reasonable way to cast their vote on election day was too much of a hassle in terms of polling stations and \*gasp* people getting the day off!!!!

What if there was no early or mail voting and everyone had to vote on the day. Does it matter if you go in at 11am and are dead by 3pm? Does it make a difference whether you die the next day at 9 am? Or does it make a difference if you die immediately after the election is conceded/decided/won?
Or would you technically have to be alive for either the majority or even ALL of that legislative period?

He only has the one trick. He can't actually *do* anything else.

This is the difference behind the words ""Serving Suggestion"" on a TV dinner box  and the actual TV dinner. This is what happens when you market and market and lie and spin - It becomes your default behaviour.  And for some reason, we all accept it.

It's just much, much easier to convince people that your product is good, than it is to actually make it good. This is why we have billboards and YouTube ads.

It's the great American Dichotomy:

*Over-engineering quality past the point where people don't complain about it is, in strict capitalist terms,  a total waste of time and money.*

So everything gets optimised to an acceptable shittiness. Everything asymptotically approaches this theoretical crap-center where everything that we do is *just* a little bit shit.

Not so shit that you don't buy it, or so shit that you take it back. But *just* the absolute tiniest poofteenth of a sliver greater than that. That's what unfettered  capitalism strives for. That's the sweet spot.

Sure, competition can (in theory) resist the gravitational shit-well  a *bit*\- but over time, the consensus point emerges, where all producers are making the most money and nobody is actually complaining.

(Nearly complaining, but *not quite*)

Trump is what you get when you apply this exact same American free market capitalist recklessness to the governance of your country. You get a gutted, shell of a system that just barely functions. It still has the flags and columns and ceremonies, but inside it's just mostly hollow. It sucks, but *not quite* entirely.

Everyone hates it but they keep consuming it anyway because it's *fine* \- mostly,  sort of. Most of the time. *Just* below the threshold where you would  want to go out in the streets and protest it.  That's the sweet spot.

It is sure as hell  not ""The greatest in the world"" although  that is absolutely what is says on the outside of the box."

Then Trump approved of police gassing and beating his own citizens. Which made everything worse and made people protest and demand change harder.

It is well established that, culminating in 1936, the political parties nearly completely inverted.  The proceeding 20 years would see the GOP become the party of rich white southerners, while the Democrats became the party of the working class and the northern states. 

The GOP of the past 70 years is literally the precise opposite of the GOP from the beginning 70 years of its existence. 

They have the same name but they're not the same party.  I'm not incorrect, because the GOP that is an organized crime ring at our current moment in history has never done anything helpful to the nation.

But this time Biden needs to not do this. It's so tempting to put the country first and move on from this horror show and try to heal. But we must remember what the allies did when Hitler was defeated. They didn't just tell people he was a bad man and then move forward. They made sure these people saw who they really supported and hated in the name of. The allies dragged the German's into the camps and made them line up and see the holocaust. It was only then for many they understood who the sick bastard was behind the curtain.

Trump is wannabe stupid Hitler and the only way his cult wake up (most not all) is if you expose the long line of cons. Not just the presidential ones but ALL of them. The fake news BS only works when Trump is in office, and the evil deep state coup wants to ruin him. Get Twittler for everything going back to the 70's and 80's. The mob mixing, the money laundering, the bank fraud. And then release the incriminating tax returns. All of them, that show the laundry list of Twittler being a fraud/con. Then indict him for ALL crimes and then Indict his family. He'll always have some part of a cult as Hitler will always have nazi lovers. But the scales will fall en masse when you cut off the head of the snake.

Biden needs to set an example to both Twittler/GOP/Cult that this crap is not normal or ok and won't be accepted. Because if Biden takes the high road this time democracy in America will fall and the GOP will come back next term or the one after with an actual competent and smart grifter.

&gt; For American society to heal, it will need to discover some semblance of truth and reconciliation to erase the shame of this proud country‚Äôs past four years.

""Truth and Reconciliation"" is a political slogan up here. It comes from the so-named ""Truth and Reconciliation Commission"" to deal with the Canadian Government's wrestling with past skeletons in their closet vis-a-vis the First Nations peoples. It ultimately prescribed a list of actionable items for organizations and governments to enact into policy to help mend the rift between the government and the people they once tried to genocide away.

governments federally and provincially notably make public apologies and host photo ops while acting in contravention to these prescriptions from the TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission).

So when we Canadians, reading a Canadian publication, see:

&gt; For American society to heal, it will need to discover some semblance of truth and reconciliation to erase the shame of this proud country‚Äôs past four years.

...what we really see is, ""The Americans need someone who will pretend to truly care about justice for people in elected office for a little while, but not really do anything differently whatsoever."""

In fact, if he adheres to separation of powers and a return to normalcy in our politics at the Federal level, he'd have to actively intervene to prevent a Trump prosecution at either the Federal or state levels.

What Biden should (and quite likely will, based on what he and his team have signaled) do is to appoint a tough, fair Attorney General, order them to right the ship of the Department of Justice, and then stay out of their hair, only working to make sure they remain independent and have the resources they need, as well as responsible oversight by Congress.

If he does that, and there's no reason to believe he won't, Trump is *fucked* and will spend the rest of his life in prison."

The entire Republican party is a crime organization.  Look at how many of them are already in prison, and that's *with them in power*.  Michael Cohen used to be the finance chair of the GOP.  He's now in jail on campaign finance violations. 

The entire party is completely morally bankrupt.  They are quite literally an organized crime ring. 

I don't use that hyperbolically.  They are a crime ring that uses their power to legitimize their criminality, and then commits a staggering degree of crime on top of that. 

They have done nothing of any value for America.  Period.  They have bankrupted the country multiple times, and most recently perpetuated one of the most egregious wealth transfers in modern history, stealing from the poor to massively enrich the already wealthy, and all while hundreds of thousands of mostly poor Americans die from a disease that they completely failed to respond to. 

They are criminals so many times over, and if the worst of them are allowed to scapegoat Trump and maintain legitimacy, we'll just be treading water."

6. Called countries led by black people that look like you, ""Shit holes"" 
7. Has said people like you (if you're black) can't lead, or be as good at business as people that look like him 
8. Has surrounded himself with people who think that 'they're doing all they can to help you. So if you're not making it, its because people like you don't want to help yourselves""
9. Has mismanaged a pandemic that has taken a much greater toll on people black people
10. Has refused to even utter the words ""black lives matter""
11. Has spent half a year supporting the police, but not saying a word to support black people (other than to say how great you've been for them?)
12. A man who has a record of stiffing the very workers who built his buildings
13. A man who, held off support from Puerto Rico, until he realized he needed to buy their votes?
14. A man who has called black women...women in general dogs, in public, on a national stage
15. A man who put in motion a plan to separate kids from their parents
16. A man who after being told his plan left 500+ kids without parents....still has not said a WORD about it
17. Took out a full page Ad asking for 5 black men accused of rape and murder to be given the death sentence...then when the it was proven then were innocent, has STILL not said a word
18. A man who has claimed that lessons teaching more about the history black people in America is ""Unamerican"" and must be banned....to make way for more PATRIOTIC history.
19. Who has said removing statues of slave masters, is UNAMERICAN

Someone please explain it to me..."
